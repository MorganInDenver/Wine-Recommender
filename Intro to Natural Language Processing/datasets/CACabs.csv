description
"There's a tannic flatness to this 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, with 12% Malbec and 12% Petit Verdot blended in. The crunchy blackberry and cassis fall somewhat flat on the palate."
"There is juicy blackberry at the core of this Cab, 2% Petit Verdot blended in for concentration and color. Dusty, the accompanying flavor players include clove and herb."
"Mature and smooth, showing brown sugar and caramel sweetness alongside tobacco and soy. Drink now."
"Minty and leafy, with fading fruit. The wine is still firm, the finish a bit sharp, but this wine isn't going to get any better than it is now."
"Dark, earthy aromas of soy or fruitcake pick up cherry flavors on the palate. While it's supple and mature, it's also the most alive of the three wines from the '80s, showing a lively, fresh finish."
"This Cabernet remains tough in tannins and a little harsh in acidity. The blackberry, roasted meat, pepper and toast flavors are rich and complex."
"This older wine is 64% from Alexander Valley and 36% from Mendocino County. It offers meaty flavors of soy and leather, the fruit elements starting to decline. It's still interesting, though, and holding on to a core of acidity. Do not decant."
"Mint again, with earth and tobacco; one taster found traces of bell pepper. Coffee and brown sugar further soften a supple, mature mouthfeel. Drink now."
"The complex nose boasts hints of spring flowers, tobacco, maple syrup and cedar. Now into its second decade, this wine is fully mature, with flavors of molasses and mushrooms that have replaced some of the cherry notes of its youth. The mouthfeel is silky and elegant; the finish chocolaty and smooth. Drink up."
"The Cherryblock Cabs seem to share a common minty characteristic that's particularly noticeable in this vintage. There's also a decent amount of cassis, earth and tobacco, and the finish remains firmly tannic. Drink or hold."
"The grapes used to make this wine were sourced from the Fort Ross area of the far Sonoma Coast. The wine has thick, supple tannins and fine acidity. It shows earthy flavors of black currant, charred meat and cedar. Give it some airing, and drink it with steaks and chops."
"The 1994 vintage saw the largest production of Cherryblock yet achieved, at 2,500 cases. But could the selection have been more severe? The wine seems mature and ready to drink, with a pleasant blend of toast and cassis, coffee and some herbaceous notes."
"Lean and angular right now, showing hints of mint and chocolate—the oak sticks out a bit over the tart cherry flavors."
"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now."
"Plenty of oak right out in front gives it a bountiful bouquet of smoke, toast, charcoal, etc. Underneath waits a nice core of black-cherry and cassis fruit, balanced with decent acids, but overall the wine seems lightweight for a reserve. It’s definitely ready to drink right now."
"A solid effort from a dependable winery that used to be known for value, back before wine—especially Cabernet—prices exploded. It hits all the right notes, with black-currant aromas and flavors, herbal or bell-pepper notes and a fancy streak of mint, complexed with lots of new French oak. Dry and rich, it finishes with dusty tannins, suggesting aging possibilities. Best after 2003."
"The aromas of powerful cedar, cherry, currant and oak suggest great concentration and focus. It’s actually a bit light on the fruit and soft in tannins, although the oak is plush and toasty. There’s certainly elegance and flavor, but it’s a wine to drink now, not age."
"This wine has very dark flavor characteristics, and is almost completely dominated by the oak barrels (40% American) in which it’s been aging for 33 months. That’s a long time, and American oak has strong aromas and flavors, perhaps too strong. The tannins are pretty and supple, and the fruit that’s buried under all that wood seems lovely, but this wine should have been released two years ago."
"Oversized, with massive berry-cherry flavors that explode in the mouth. In fact, it's too big. The spicy fruity flavors are so powerful they dominate every other feature. That said, it's dry, and the tannins are soft and intricate. Match it with dramatic, boldly flavored dishes. —S.H."
"Don’t look for Napa-esque depth or richness in South Coast Cabs. The frame is leaner, the flavors more austere. This wine seems thin and sharp, but there’s something about it—a sense of terroir, personality, call it what you will—that’s likable, even complex. It’s a bit aggressive right now, but should soften nicely with 2 or 3 years in the cellar."
"A nicely crafted wine with all the attributes of fine Cabernet: plush black-currant and berry fruit, a dose of vanilla-scented oak, and sage notes. Drinks dry and smooth, with a few tannins to shed. Finishes rough, but pretty good, especially at this giveaway price."
"Somehow, this fine winery gets left off a lot of “best of” lists, which makes it a great value, especially from a super vintage like ‘97. This is serious Napa Cabernet, filled with fancy black currant, cassis and mocha, and complex with toasty oak. It's very dry and elegant, one of those wines that fills the palate with the most sumptuous flavors and textures. It's so focused, it's delicious now, but there's no doubt it will age and improve for a long time."
"This big, burly Cab is a Napa Valley tradition. The cedar and cassis aromas and flavors are classic, but boast an untamed, briary wildness to them that gives Bosche its own identity. Finishes long but tart, with mouth-drying tannins that need time to resolve. Drink 2007-2012."
"Tobacco and some green pepper on an otherwise fruity plain. When you think of cru bourgeois Bordeaux, this fits the image and flavor profile. It's lean, but balanced. Tea and licorice are definable on the finish."
"This fabulous vintage offered all sorts of possibilities. The winery chose an austere route. Tightly controlled blackberry and cassis notes are wrapped in oak, and the wine is very dry. It may age. If you drink it now, do so with the richest beef or lamb you can find. —S.H."
"This is a really nice Cab. It has a rich, dark color, and pretty aromas of black currants, tobacco, blackberry, anise and mint. The flavors are similar, but what strikes you is the richness and balance. Such pretty fruit, ripe and polished, just delicious. The tannins are moderate, so you can drink it up right away."
"An estate-bottled, unfiltered 100% Cabernet, it’s an open, loose-knit wine, with soft, plummy fruit, some vanilla-cream notes and a sweet finish."
"A plush, fancy Cabernet with all the trimmings. Ripe, opulent fruit is the foundation; above that, oak provides spicy complexities. The tannins are supersoft and plush, like drinking velvet, which may not contribute to the wine’s longevity but definitely makes it pleasing to drink right now."
"Ripe and juicy, here’s a Cab that rises to the occasion, with fine currant, berry and herbal aromas, compounded with spicy oak. Very dry and fancy, it offers plenty of balance and harmony, and tastes soft, rich and complex."
"Ripe fruit, augmented with a little earthiness, some barnyard scents, and then layers of dark spice and smoke."
"This is a young, hearty wine, dark and brooding, whose power is still considerably closed in. The aroma hints at blackberry preserves, anise and milk chocolate. It’s soft and accessible, with tons of concentrated, ripe berry fruit, but needs a few years to show its best stuff. Finishes long and spicy."
"Here’s a soft, supple wine of great character and harmony from an underrated producer. It has pretty earthy-berry aromas. While it’s not very oaky there’s enough to give a hint of smoke and vanilla. On the light side, with soft tannins and somewhat low acidity, but the overall impression is very likable and elegant. This is a racy wine to drink now while your bigger ’97 Cabs are maturing in the cellar."
"Very tasty and large in scale, it sports a huge nose of dark plum and heavy cedar, along with cinnamon and vanilla accents wrapped in very toasty oak. Very dark fruit with licorice shadings and an elegant, supple mouthfeel add to the appeal. The dark flavors and heavy toast continue on the long finish, which doesn't want to quit."
"A full load of berry fruit in the nose, black-currant flavors and extremely even balance. It features an attractive set of cherry and cassis flavors, and the heavy tannins that hit home on the long finish, while fairly starching, don't stand in the way of the overall pleasure it gives."
"Blackberry aromas have a Port-like character and a smoky undertone. Big extraction leaves a thick, weighty mouthfeel and the essence of Cabernet's sweetness. Some mineral, coffee and meat on the lengthy finish. A good mix of finesse and wildness."
"Herbs and toast play off the standard fare of blackberries and plums, creating a good whole. It's full, deep, and long—a thoroughbred. Another of those wines that everyone with a taste for California Cabernet should like. Charming and high in quality, if not necessarily ultracomplex."
"Foster's should be a happy new owner of this property. Here there's a concentrated bouquet of smoky, toasty oak and full red fruit backed up by tobacco, bitter chocolate and buttery oak. If you are a fan of heavily wooded wines you'll love this. It finishes extremely smooth and long."
"A youthful, exciting wine that offers plenty of earth and cassis. It seems tight and closed now, with packed in tannins, a condensed mouthfeel and some mild green pepper notes on the tail end. Definitely a wine for the cellar. Give it some time and it should open up its wings."
"Another in the new N&N; line, the Sullenger features red and black fruit, herbs, some earth, and an appealing whiff of sautéed pancetta or bacon. Commendable richness in support of black-plum flavor and coffee notes. Its poundcake-like density urges cellaring."
"Floral, exciting and chocolaty, this is a dense, rich, well-crafted beauty. Yummy is one of the best ways to describe it. It has full but friendly tannins, all the length you could ask for, and in the final analysis it leaves an impression of heft and significance."
"Very aromatic, showing a complex nose of cherry, spice, smoked and raw meat, and tobacco. The flavors are copious, too, with strong black cherry, licorice and tobacco elements. Balance and structure are beautiful here, and the coffee-chocolate finish has very good length, showing spice and blueberry accents. Lovely already, it will be better in four years and will drink well to 2010."
"A fine wine at the bottom of the ultrapremium price category. There's some bramble and forest aromas in advance of jammy cherry and blackberry fruit. Fades away smoothly and with good length. Not the most complex Cabernet, but it delivers the goods at all checkpoints."
"Alexander Valley has a rep for soft, forward Cabs of great deliciousness but, perhaps, a lack of complexity. That description fits this dark, young wine, except for one thing: It’s complex. You’ll find all the spicy-curranty depths of flavor you want, and plenty of oak, and it will even age, because the tannins, while soft, are intricate."
"Very smooth and harmonious, from its cherry, cocoa and smoke-tinged aromatics through the similarly endowed palate, where licorice and cedar notes add further complexity. Balanced, not weighty; it closes with very even tannins and a full, even black-cherry finish with toasty notes. Approachable now; will improve over the next three years."
"Structured and built for the long haul, the densely packed aromatics hint at the power within. Blackberry, earth, fruitcake and cinnamon are all there, and the palate delivers a similar mix with added coffee, cocoa and licorice elements. Great texture and weight, and a lengthy finish with dry, even tannins. Best if cellared four to six years, and will keep for ages."
"Opens with blockbuster notes of blueberry, cassis, licorice, smoke and earth, all the while displaying great depth. Finely integrated cherry, herb, espresso, oak and soy flavors have that intense vitality that command attention. Full and well proportioned on the palate, the wine finishes long, with beautiful fruit and big but very even tannins."
"Great depth and purity of fruit. It shines with lovely violet and lavender accents. Very dark cassis, black plum, coffee and toasty oak flavors, with handsome herb and spice accents. The mouthfeel is excellent—big, but almost perfectly balanced between lush richness and solid tannic structure. A keeper needing four to six years."
"Toasty oak is wrapped around some complex elements: blackberry, violets, tar, cedar, coffee and game. Big, very dark fruit, tobacco and toast flavors soar, and the mouthfeel is intense yet not weighty. Fine structure on the finish, with black-currant fruit and tar, coffee and cocoa accents. Great potential; hold two to five years at least."
"Simply a spectacular wine; a Napa prototype for fabulous Cabernet. Cassis, tobacco and cedar commingle on the nose, followed by luscious cassis fruit that's backed up by exemplary barrel notes—both in flavor and in texture. So smooth and deft, it's the epitome of class. Give it about five years in the cellar and then indulge."
"A profoundly deep nose of red and black fruit, with cedar, ginger and nutmeg. The sense of balance and grace is sublime, as layers of cassis, plum and cinnamon keep unfolding. The chewy finish is lengthy and elegant, and it should be held for no less than five years. This bottling honors its pedigree as California's first classic Cabernet."
"Fine clarity of fruit, with coffee, cherry and nicely utilized oak. Intense flavors of blackberry, plum and cedar mark the palate, which displays a full texture. The long, smooth and tangy finish wraps it up nicely. Drinks well now; will be even better after two or three years."
"Earthy, meaty and spicy-it's what Napa Cabernet is supposed to be. Perfectly balanced, smooth and totally correct, it has cherry and chocolate in spades and lots of grip. In the end it's all about class and performance."
"Rarely does a Cabernet of this quality carry the basic ""California"" appellation, but here it does, and who should care? Deep black fruit with perfect oak makes for the ultimate in integration. A long cocoa and spice finish closes the show. Wonderfully sweet, round and delicious."
"Full-priced, full-bodied, and the full complement of just about all you want in a Rutherford Cab. Port-like aromas lead a pure and layered palate that features cassis, cherry, tobacco and cocoa. What an array of flavors, and then it finishes with dusty tannins and a tight grip. The gang at BV sure know how to craft Cabernet."
"Lush and forward, with complex sour-plum, espresso, cola, vanilla and fudge aromas. Round berry flavors, licorice, Asian spice and pepper accents mark the palate. Full, but not heavy, with a long, smooth plum and cocoa finish. This is a stylish and elegant black knight."
"The word ""black"" applies to a number of things here: cherry, coffee, currant. Cola is another part of the fabulous mix. Tons of polish, and creamy and rich. A palate-pleaser supreme; there's a lot of class and breed here. Fine and fancy, with excellent weight. What more could you ask for?"
"A can't-miss Cabernet with a rich nose of blackberry, plum, coffee and oak. It's so dense that the cassis, wood, and coffee flavors come across as being tarry. The smooth, stylish finish is packed full of woodiness, licorice and fine tannins. Simply put, it's full of style and a whole lot of fun to drink."
"Deep earth, tobacco and dark plums on the nose, and a lovely cool note. Dark fruit on the palate keeps that cool profile going. The flavorful finish rolls on and on, not missing a beat, with beautiful black fruit and espresso notes. An appealing black beauty, best after three years and out through 2010."
"Score one for Sonoma Valley and this winery, as the '97 exceeds previous efforts. Lots of enticing deep-berry aromas touched up with leather, dill, and an array of other spices and herbs, even oregano. It's one of those rock-solid winners where the whole is more profound than the parts."
"The big, very dark and inviting nose of ripe cherry, licorice, cocoa and toast sets things up. The dense palate is packed with cherry, tar, even bacon notes, and it has a plush, velvety feel that belies the wine's structure. The impressive finish is dark and toasty, with well-dispersed tannins. Cellar two to four years."
"A dry-smelling wine, with hints of cinnamon, pine bark, eucalyptus and earth, that unfold slowly on the palate to reveal bright red cherries and berries. It's big and it's structured, yet finishes smooth and silky, blending in coffee and tea notes. Approachable now, but better after 2005."
"Complex aromas of cassis, dough, espresso, bacon, and cola create instant interest. It seduces with its rich dark fruit and earth flavors, and a concentrated, suave mouthfeel. Big flavors and tannins don't quit on the long, even finish. Profoundly enjoyable, seamless and shows impeccable balance. Keep for five to seven years; it will last a long time."
"The lovely bouquet of blackberry jam, oak with mint, cedar, and black olives draws you in. Broad and rich on the palate, with ample but fine tannins. Great depth of dark-berry fruit, with coffee and cedar shadings. The explosive finish just keeps going as intriguing sweet-tart fruit and bitter chocolate notes please all the way out. Best to hold six to nine years."
"Very solid and deep, with a bouquet of delicious black-currant and dark-cherry fruit and toasty, buttery oak. Very comfortable mouthfeel. Full, with layered fruit and a long and elegant finish that sports big but not sharp tannins. Tight now; hold for three to six years."
"The nose here offers a real mixed bag: some funk, a little perfume, worn leather, even pepperoni and peanuts. The mouth blends flavors of black fruit with peppery spice and herbs. It may be a touch linear and tight, but the basics are definitely there. Overall a very good wine."
"Heavily oaked, with peanut aromas masking the fruit. But in the mouth it has more accessible fruit—mostly cassis—and once again the full allotment of wood. It's no surprise when it finishes buttery, and with coffee flavors. A tough one to call now. Will the wood integrate? Will the fruit emerge?"
"Big mountain fruit here throws powerful aromas of ripe plum, thyme and bacon, while full-scale oaking yields maple aromas, vanilla flavors, and coffee on the finish. The wood element is a little weighty at this point, but there's solid fruit to support it."
"Some cedar and olives accent an earthy nose. Cassis and some cherry make up the pleasant palate, which features nicely integrated oak as a high point. Fairly long and drying on the back end, with ever-so-slightly prickly tannins."
"Impressive and elegant, this one leans American with its R & B name and packaging, but is rather French in profile. The black-cherry fruit is offset by a lead-pencil element reminiscent of some top Bordeaux chateaus. Angular and fairly crisp, it shows coffee accents and a fairly long finish. If it adds some weight with age, it will drink above the present rating."
"Leathery fruit and a bit of bramble or field greens mark the nose, and the earthy red-currant palate strikes a claret-like note. It's a little lighter than the competition, and it does show some defined tartness. Drink sooner than later, and try to serve it with food."
"Made by Cathy Corison, this wine is now in its second vintage, where it shows black-cherry fruit touched up by leather and spice. A big wine needing some time to come together; it is stylish for sure, with a vivid, exciting finish."
"Cassis, menthol, black olive, and some alfalfa make for a complex bouquet. It's undoubtedly forward—red fruit, chocolate and vanilla on the palate—with a piercing quality that could subside with age. This wine has the stuff to please: it's round, mouthfilling and very correct."
"Fairly heavy and full, with a powerfully spicy and chocolaty nose. Dark-fruit and herb tastes are accented by a strong shot of coffee from the oak. The finish is tannic and drying, with more of that coffee and also some notes of licorice. Perfectly chunky, in the Napa/Oakville style."
"Red fruit in the nose is accented by a little tomato, some juniper and blueberry, and a fair amount of barrel char. Features a mouth of leaner black cherry and tart plum. Finishes dry, and with mouth-coating tannins. Now it's harmonious, but it could use some time to soften up."
"Some sweetness in the form of kirsch and Port, as well as chocolate and the clear essence of wood shavings. At only 53% Cabernet, there's lots of Merlot-influenced red fruit. It's more light and elegant than many dense Napa Cabs and keeps a reserved nature all the way through to the end."
"Blackberry and vanilla make for a sweet, syrupy bouquet. The fruit on the palate is nice—it's mostly cherry and cassis. The finish is potent and slightly tart. Now it's hard to assess, as it's short on dimensions. Could use some time to integrate its components."
"Black-cherry and plum aromas on the nose open to similar flavors, with toast and mineral accents on the palate. An elegant and refined wine, with a lengthy finish that displays cassis and earth flavors, and moderate, even tannins. Not a heavy or fat wine, it shows very good balance and should be cellared for three to five years."
"Meaty and also jammy, with popcorn and cedar aromas. Dry and complex, typical of the winery's style, and mildly astringent. The tannins are starching at this point, but should fade. Given time, the red fruit should emerge and conquer the youthful astringency."
"Solid and elegant, this standard-bearer offers round, plummy aromas and flavors, as well as cocoa and tobacco accents. The fruit is very clean and bright, and the flavors well defined on the lush, well-balanced palate. Finishes dark and juicy, with fine tannins. This wine should improve over the next three to five years, and then drink well until 2008."
"Extremely dark, with toast, cherry liqueur and forest notes on the nose; this opens into deep black fruit, licorice and espresso flavors. The mouthfeel is full and rich, as it transitions effortlessly into a smooth, dry, anise and briar-tinged finish that has an interesting and elegant viscosity to it. A black beauty needing three to five years to develop."
"“Swan Song” indicates that this is the last vintage of Cabernet to be produced from this vineyard block. So enjoy it while it's here: There's plenty of dry black cherry, licorice, cola and smoked meat, and dusty tannins with nice grip close the show. Our critique is that this is an excellent finalé."
"Deep, pungent dark-berry aromas open this round, inviting cherry and raspberry flavored wine. Round and almost overly suave on the palate, it has ample black cherry, chocolate and toast flavors, and closes with a finish sporting dried fruits. The dry, talcum-like tannins allow for early drinking."
"Taut but complex aromatics of black plum, chocolate, soy, and cedar open this very dark-hued contender. The oak here is lavish, and the wine appeals with its dark-cherry and toast flavors. Closes with a dry, evenly tannic finish. The insistent heavy toast makes it perhaps a bit of a one-noter, but it's a good example of this popular style."
"A power-packed heavyweight from Sonoma, this delivers a piercing black-fruit aroma and flavor profile. Cassis and plum flavors are tight and tasty, and the long, juicy finish indicates that it could evolve nicely. Anyone planning on drinking it soon should expect a punch. Elegance is not its strong suit right now."
"A bouquet of dark red fruits and heavy cedar accents opens this even, well-balanced offering. Looks and tastes mature; the dry, cherry-chocolate flavors are forward, and it closes with handsome tobacco and cedar notes. Appealing and ready to go. Drink now to 2004."
"An unmistakable meatiness marks the nose, and then there's some Middle Eastern spices like cumin and coriander. Earthy and full of black-fruit flavor, with oak pouring in late. Try to ignore the bulky young tannins; assume the wine will mature and find its stride down the road."
"The full, grapey nose is vintage Cabernet, but it's not particularly complex. There's a little razor's edge to the cherry fruit, with herbal notes on the astringent finish. In a word, it's crisp and tight."
"Full, complex bouquet of dark berries, tobacco and smoke, with a cool pine note adding interest. Similar flavors follow on the palate, and the texture is lean and refined, with very good fruit-to-acid balance. The long, supple finish offers sweet black fruit buttressed by toasty oak and supported by brisk tannins. Oaky, in a Bordeaux manner, and very elegant."
"Clean and nice upfront, with blackberry aromas and sweet vanilla. A lot of heft to the palate, and plenty of cassis flavor and tobacco nuance on the finish. Oak rears up on the finish. Needs some time."
"Deep and sweet, but there's also an unusual and appetizing edge offered via cola nut and root beer. Any tartness to the blackberry fruit is offset by vanillin oak. Pleasurable, full-bodied and on the money. It's stylish good stuff with a correct amount of woody character."
"Not your standard blackberry-and-oak bomb: there's zing and snap, and even a whiff of mint to the nose. Deep and full-flavored, with chocolate, coffee and some earthiness. It has the length and supple tannins to qualify it as a winner. Quite pure and focused."
"Vanilla and cream, cocoa, and herbs really jazz up the medium-berry nose. Dark sweet fruit in the mouth, with some earth and cedar for substance. Bitter chocolate and espresso add backbone to the medium-length finish. Good and balanced, and not bad for current consumption."
"The bouquet is dark and serious, with brooding black-cherry, leather and cedar aromas. In the mouth, flavors of black plums, mint-menthol and tobacco—all with a foresty accent—fill the palate. On the heavy side of medium-weight, with a supple texture, it has a long, toasty finish with fine tannins. Hold until 2004."
"Absolutely opaque—it's definitely one of the darkest, inkiest wines out there. The black-currant nose shows lots of depth, with vanilla and cinnamon shadings. Though it is massive and a bit unpenetrable now, the softness, blackberry fruit and full tannins suggest it will be really nice in a few years. Just expect a real fruit ball."
"Cherry cough drops in a pleasant way on the nose, and then a medium-berry mouth, spice, light cedar and raspberries—there's a whole lot going on here. Not heavy on the complexity; rather it delivers clean fruit and simple spice."
"Sports an explosively fruity nose of berry and plum, with cloves and toasty oak in support. Medium-weight, with very nice fruit and good structure, it displays some engaging chocolate and spice notes. The finish is brisk and tangy, with bitter cocoa notes and firm, drying tannins. Hold until 2005."
"A tasty, toasty wine at a very fair price. It's a tad bulky, and it's packed with plum, cherry and coffee flavors. The mouth is nothing if not full, with some dry tannins adding necessary structure. Slightly one-dimensional and limited in scope, but what's here is oh so nice and friendly."
"Bramble and cedar, along with plenty of toasty vanillin oak. Black currant is the dominant fruit; the mouthfeel is appropriately big, and the finish turns a bit dry, but with proper length. Very nice in the typical Napa mold."
"A complex bouquet with prune, earth, and some prominent gamy notes may put some tasters off, but the dark fruit and toast, and the generally restrained style make this commendable. A velvety mouthfeel and dense flavors on the finish close out this elegant example. Best after three years and good to 2008 and beyond."
"Tight red fruit and a solid whack of oak make for a fine wine. Tobacco mingles with coffee on the otherwise black-cherry and curranty palate. It's definitely clean and polished, and will drink well for the next three to five years."
"At the bottom end of our range, this stalwart is tightly wound and fairly driven. Plum and cassis on the palate offer just the slightest nuance of cured Italian meat. Coffee is dominant on the long, linear finish. Now it's pretty dark and unevolved. Patience will be rewarded."
"Like a nice Bordeaux, there's some barnyard aromas—but also a leathery spiciness with accents of cinnamon, chocolate and espresso. Impressive balance and breadth. Not too high strung—instead it's soft, smooth, almost heavy. A good wine to drink early on."
"Smells young and juicy, with ripe blackberry, chocolate and olivaceous notes, and a dollop of smoky oak. Drinks fruity and dry, with a bite of acidity, and finishes sharp. Contains a little Merlot from Marin County and some Cabernet Franc from Amador County in the Sierra Foothills"
"Yes, 1997 is the current vintage. Reviewers gave this wine's bouquet two thumbs up—it has lovely aromas of wheat biscuit, mint and cassis. Our biggest gripe here was the wine's weight—which, for a Cabernet from a good vintage, was pretty light. Still, it had some pleasant cherry, red plum and earth flavors."
"This fine wine straddles the border between good and complex. The elements are terrific: pedigreed blackberry and cassis fruit, fine oak nuances, and soft Sonoma tannins. It's just a tad thin in the middle. Drink it with meat."
"Opens with blackberries and spices; fruity, forward and polished. Dry, with good tannins and balance, but just can't break through a certain ceiling."
"Blackberries and some funk in the nose: earth, leather, even a whiff of banana. Dark chocolate and an interesting citrus element add character to the standard berry fruit in the mouth. It's youthful juice, needing time to flesh itself out; now there's a lot of rambunctious black oak, which makes the wine seem a bit one-dimensional."
"Thunder Mountain wines often display a lot of character and evoke strong responses from our tasters. This ultradark Cabernet is no exception, with its overt heavy toast and black-olive aromas and flavors, heavy extraction, and full, but somewhat astringent, mouthfeel. Through all this it remains compelling, if not presently accessible. Needs five to seven years."
"A little reticent and cool at first; patient airing allows it to open up and display raspberry, cola and herbal aromatics, followed by spicy black-cherry fruit. It's a very clean, pure, proper wine that will competently grace most dinner tables."
"Opens with bright, tart fruit displaying berry, cherry and rhubarb qualities. This north-country candidate has good scale and mouthfeel. Berry, earth and leather flavors, smooth dry tannins, and a dusty earth note on the finish close out this medium-weight and balanced offering. Drink now through 2008."
"Dark berry, leather and herbaceous notes on the nose open to cherry, currant and tobacco flavors—it's all very much in the Bordeaux vein. The mouthfeel is similar: somewhat lean and angular but very flavorful, with an expansive cherry flavor on the spicy, long finish. Has good tannic structure, and may merit a higher score with some age. Hold for four to six years, and then drink til 2012."
"Interesting aromatics of cumin, tree bark, chocolate and more on top of black fruit: cassis and plum, mostly. Oak and currants bring it home, with a fair share of toasted oak speaking up on the finish. Rich, plush and drinkable almost immediately."
"A creamy drop of vanilla turns the red fruit this way and that; at one moment it's peppery and offers tastes of fennel, and then it is pure plums and cassis. Dry, dusty and earthy, this wine shows solid fundamentals. The early line is for a strong future."
"Black fruit with a touch of prune and meat on the nose. Oak-lashed plums and currants in the mouth taste a bit burnt from the wood treatment. A woody express train, with lots of coffee. Fans of dark, structured, oaky wines will get a kick out of this one."
"Rich, dense and cool, with an overt menthol streak. The fat, tangy fruit has a cedar edge and also a pronounced piercing quality. Round, voluminous, tannic and in general quite big. Now the wood is a bit heavy-handed. A year or two on its side should help it along."
"A little prune, cherry and tobacco mix on the nose with some leafiness, creating a bouquet similar to Bordeaux. Black cherry and licorice are the predominant flavors, and in the end game there's a subdued coffee-tinged, reserved character to it."
"Easy-drinking, this is an example of a lighter, but still very satisfying style of Cabernet. The bouquet is tart berries, cedar, tobacco and rhubarb. Smooth and evenly textured, the palate displays cola and sweet tobacco flavors. Tangy tannins and dried fruit and spice flavors on the finish close this forward charmer from Mendocino."
"A big mouth-filling offering with lots of oak/cedar and coffee/mocha shadings. Sweet-and-sour stewed berry flavors and black-toast accents play on the fairly large-scaled palate. A tart chocolate note enters on the finish, which displays firm but fine tannins. It's the best Cabernet we've ever tasted from this Kosher winery, and it should improve over the next two to four years."
"Plummy aromas, black-cherry and oak, and accents of vanilla and cream. It's tight now, fairly begging for time to unfold. Presently the cherry core borders on tart. With time it should soften."
"Crisp in the nose, with nuances of graham cracker, menthol, mushroom and herbs. Those herbal notes carry into the flavor profile and mix with plum and oak. It opens up a little and becomes fairly friendly on the finish, where the tannins are medium."
"Packed in upfront, with some atypical grassy, wildflower aromas. Chunky fruit and Port-like flavors make a statement, as does a black-tea note on the finish. Slightly clumsy now, the hope here is that some time in the cellar will help weld any incongruent elements."
"An inviting and fragrant nose of blackberry, soy, vanilla and pine opens this medium-weight offering. Tangy, with tart berry, brown sugar and tobacco, it has a bracing mouthfeel with firm acidity, reading almost like a Tuscan red on the palate. Tart and sweet, the finish is brisk."
"This beautiful single-vineyard wine takes all the themes of the regular Wente Cabernet and carries them into deeper, lusher, more complex territory. The color is darker, the depth of flavor more profound, the fruit veering more toward black currants, the tannins more refined, and the fruity-spicy finish simply wonderful and long."
"A solid effort from this fine winery, from a vintage everyone is increasingly admitting was more difficult than it looked. It’s as middle of the road as you can get. It strikes all the right notes in terms of ripe, polished black-currant fruit, anise and smoky oak, yet never quite achieves complexity. Nonetheless there’s enough harmony and juiciness to satisfy."
"Among the better '98s, this wine's vineyard pedigree shows in the polished fruit and supple tannins, the result of great terroir. The aromas suggest black cherries and blackberries with intense oaky, smoky tones. Particularly notable for the soft, lush mouthfeel, like sipping pure velvet. If the wine were more concentrated it would be classic."
"Here's what a great estate does. there's no mistaking the pedigree, from the sumptuous, velvety texture to the exciting balance. It's class all the way from the elegant entry to the long, spicy finish. A hollow center says it won't age, but it's pretty nice stuff."
"Inky dark, this wine brims with important aromas of cassis, mint and fine, smoky oak. Fully ripe Cabernet blackberry flavors are wrapped in elegant tannins, dry and dusty. The structure is impeccable, the finish long. It's complex but approachable enough for immediate drinking."
"The best Napa Cabs are soft, concentrated and supple. This pretty wine is all that. It combines the power of sun-ripened fruit with a reluctance on the winemaker's part to overwhelm. This dry wine impresses through restraint, not a knock to the head. The right foods will make it sing."
"This excellent and rich wine smells beautiful, and coats the mouth with velvety smoothness. The flavors range from green olives to tobacco and blackberries, with oaky complexities. The finish is dry, spicy and intense."
"There’s some really fine Cabernet character in this affordable wine, which contains 10% Merlot. It’s got black-currant and plum fruit, finely etched and pure, with a light touch of oak, and there’s some real substance and depth of flavor. You’ll be surprised at the classiness at this price. It’s a mystery how this winery achieves wines this good when they could be selling them for much more. Best Buy."
"Here’s a country-style Cab that won’t break the bank but offers solid value. The fruit is light and clean, suggesting blackberries and plums, with oregano and thyme notes and the slightest touch of toasty oak. Tannins are soft but fine, and it finishes very dry."
"Certainly more aromatic than the regular bottling, with black-currant notes, anise and fairly strong charred oak. Dry, with softly complex tannins and some berry fruit, but again, it seems a little light and thin."
"Starts out with earthy, berryish aromas, and drinks earthy and light, with just a suggestion of berry fruit. Simple and one-dimensional. An everyday wine with a slight tannic bite."
"At this price you don’t expect much, but it’s actually pretty good juice. Has all the proper ingredients: blackberry and plum fruit, some spice, and a touch of oak. It’s rough, but there’s enough good stuff going on to give it a qualified recommendation in the value category."
"They say the grapes come from Lake, Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties. There are some pretty good black-currant and oak aromas, but the flavors are thin and sharp. It’s well made, as you’d expect. Still, the overall impression is lean and austere."
"Starts out with rough, earthy blackberry and cassis aromas, with deeper notes of plum and chocolate. Drinks very soft and velvety, almost too much so; seems to lack acidity and vibrancy. At this price, though, you can’t expect miracles."
"Here's a wine that will surprise you. It has real richness and varietal flavor, and is dry and balanced, with the weight you want in a nice Cabernet. Might even get a little better in another year or two."
"Of this winery's two new releases, the less expensive is better, because this usually fine release is from the infamous ‘98 vintage. It just can't overcome a basic thinness and wateriness, despite an obvious pedigree and plush oak. That said, it's a good wine. The ‘99 will undoubtedly be much better."
"Good, but disappointing. Blackberry, mint, chocolate and black cherry flavors are pretty, but thin, and the weight on the palate, the way the wine feels, is light and watered down. This absence of depth lets the alcohol and tannins star. It's obviously well-made, but is not a wine for the cellar."
"A very nice wine, with good, ripe black-currant fruit; dry and balancedwith aromas and flavors of sweet, smoky oak. The flash is on the surface and it's a little sharp, so it's not an ager. But it's a tasty wine."
"It's shy in the nose, with suggestions of cassis and smoky oak, while the flavors veer toward berries and spices, swimming in firm tannins and sharp acidity. It's a delicate wine, one of finesse rather than power, but it is very good. A long, sweetly ripe finish suggests ageability, but it's probably at its youthful, fleshy best now."
"Defines what makes this appellation great for Cabernet, but also why it won't rival Napa anytime soon. Brilliantly ripe fruit, lovely balance, such a pretty taste of the earth and, in this case, expensive oak. But there's that extra something it aspires to and doesn't quite achieve. It has to do with complexity of tannins."
"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness."
Creamy black cherry aromas layered with fresh brussel sprouts and spicy arugula flavors of red plums and toasted oak.
"Certainly one of the successes of the vintage. Packed with cassis, sage, plum, tobacco, earth and smoky oak, and perfectly dry and balanced. Sheer joy in the mouth, like liquid velvet. It changes every second, offering up tiers of flavors through the spicy finish."
"One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday. This is what middleweight Cabernet Sauvignon sans oak tastes like: all fresh blackberries and cherries, with undercurrants of espresso and sweet spice. A remarkably tasty wine that should be easy to find: There were 65,000 cases produced."
"Dark as night, and with such a dramatic aroma, you can't wait to taste it. Huge and hedonistic, an Incredible Hulk of a wine bursting with blackcurrants and cassis and smoky oak. Luxurious tannins make for a smooth, gentle mouthfeel. Enjoy this youthful wine now."
"Powerful and dramatic, packed with polished flavors of blackcurrants and cassis, sweet roasted pepper, and dried herbs. Tannins are thick and there's a bite of acidity in the finish, suggesting that this delicious young wine will age. But it's drinkable now."
"This immensely likeable wine, from the Oak Knoll section of the valley, avoids the overly fat, soft fruit of warmer areas, while preserving vital acidity. There's plenty of cassis fruit, and 50% new oak, but it's wonderfully balanced, with a modest 13.5% alcohol. You might easily mistake it for a fine St.-Julien, it's that good."
"Continues the Shafer tradition of richly fruity Cabs, with near-perfect tannins and just-right oak, and an elegant suppleness that's delicious and distinctive in youth, but ageworthy. The fine vintage has made the wine extra-complex and balanced. Over the years, many wineries have arisen, but few have a better track record than Shafer."
"Fruit is redder than it is black, with prominent plum, cherry and even raspberry fruit; one reviewer found an offputting hint of greenness. Smooth and supple in the mouth, it's a solid, well-built Cab that should be drunk sooner than later."
"Asian spice notes grace modest black cherry and herb flavors in this lightweight offering from the Sierras. Finishes short, with some charred-wood notes."
"Sappy, grapey fruit is joined by strong herbal overtones reminiscent of dried oregano and parsley. While some panelists felt it had potential to develop over the next couple of years, others dismissed it for saline aromas that they termed “fishy.”"
"A good, richly flavored Cabernet that shows proper varietal character without any special qualities. Flavors of blackcurrants drink dry, wrapped in smooth tannins. May improve a bit with a few years in the cellar."
"Here's a good example of what's so disturbing about the rash of expensive Cabernets and blends that has possessed the minds of consumers. This is an awkward, cumbersome wine. Sure, the fruit is as ripe as anything on earth, but what good is extract if it doesn't have balance? The wine is excessively soft. It's cloying, and to add insult to injury, it's tannic. There are wines that cost one-fifth the price that are far better."
"Simple and earthy, with coffee and spiced plum flavors. Curiously lean and one-dimensional for such a great vintage. The tannins are soft and melted and acids are also easy."
"Consistently one of the best Cabernets made south of the Bay Area, this year the wine is especially tasty. Not too ripe, with suggestions of blackberry and cassis and herbs, and some good, old-fashioned tannins."
"Chocolaty and spicy, loaded with cinnamon and anise, and backed by sturdy plum-flavored fruit. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich; the finish, long and oaky."
"From this Calistoga vineyard, a first rate Cabernet, sumptuous and elegant. The fruit straddles an interesting line between herbaceous, green olive notes and riper ones of blackberries. Feels just great in the mouth, plush and sensual. Unquestionably an ager."
"Smooth, viscous and velvety on the palate. This is always St. Supéry's best shot at Cabernet, sporting black currant, blackberry, sage, thyme, coffee and anise flavors. They weave their way along the palate to a long finish. —J.M."
"West Side, in Paso Robles, means hot, and while the alcohol in this wine is a moderate 13.5%,  you can taste the heat in the gentle tannins and soft acids. It's bone-dry, with berry flavors. A nicely crafted young wine. —S.H."
"Still a baby, and easy to misunderstand, but this is one serious puppy.  Youthful tannins and acids frame juvenile, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, and oak has been tastefully applied. But the rich core of fruit, and overall balance, urge longterm aging for a good ten years."
"Another terrific Napa ‘99, this one packed with opulent flavors of cassis, green olives and herbs, wrapped generously in fine toasty oak. The wine is very dry and the tannins are fine and complex. The delicious finish goes on and on."
"Big and rich in the mouth, with gorgeous, velvety tannins. Offers a juicy plum and cassis core, with oak, tobacco and earth accents, and a char and cocoa notes on the back end. As compelling as the flavors are, it'll be the mouthfeel that wins you over (this is one of those Cabs that could taste like eggs Benedict and still be delicious—its mouthfeel is that good)."
"From estate vineyards and winemaker Celia Welch Masyczek, a gorgeous Cabernet with the kind of tannin structure you expect from a great vintage in Napa Valley. Deep, impressive flavors of blackcurrants, but it's pretty tannic now and requires up to a decade to soften. At today's prices, this one is a relative bargain."
"Good and rich and classy, with excellently ripe blackberry, currant and herb flavors and a nice overlay of toasty oak. Tannins are as fine as can be, smooth and complex, although they're young and tend to stun the palate."
"Here's a soft, juicy wine with melted tannins in the modern style and some nice blackberry flavors. It's young now, a saucy wine that hasn't yet fully come together. But all the pieces are there. Drink it at three or four years of age."
"The grapes are real nice and ripe here, offering up flavors of blackberries and cherries that are succulent and mellow. Smoky oak adds the spicy, sweetly woody nuances from barrel aging. A problem is that the wine is too soft and a little flabby.  —S.H."
"Has the soft, easy but complex tannins that made the appellation famous, and bracing acidity underpinning blackberry, olive and herb flavors. Feels good and rich in the mouth. Try cellaring it for a few years."
"Seems a bit hard and lean for a ‘99, especially a reserve. Pretty tannic now, although there's some blackberry fruit at the core. Oak provides additional nuances of smoke and spice. Hard to tell where it's going."
"What rich flavors there are here. With this fabulous vintage that ripened the grapes perfectly, it would be hard not to find plush  blackberry, cassis and other herb and spice flavors. The tannins are just a bit brash and bold, suggesting a year or so of aging to calm things down."
"Has its work cut out for it. Fundamentally a one-dimensional, country-style wine, it's clean and soft, with earthy, berry flavors, and dry tannins. Would benefit from extra depth, complexity and concentration. —S.H."
"From the famous class of ‘99 Cabs, a softly rich, voluptuous wine, brimming with cassis and blackcurrant flavors generously framed in oak. Lacks a bit of stuffing and complexity, but on the surface, tasty stuff."
"Offers a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a red plum-fruit core, with caramel and tobacco accents. Aromas are of figs and Indian spices; one reviewer found the fruit a bit candied. This is a very good Cab, drinkable in the near term, though not one that necessarily merits such a lofty price tag. Finishes with bitter chocolate."
"From master winemaker Dick Arrowood, and pretty good for a regional-based wine. A politically correct Cabernet with cassis flavors, good oak, very dry, stylish tannins and low acidity. There's not a lot going on below the surface but it gets the job done."
"Sweet roasted red pepper, black plum, black cherry and delicious apple aromas lead to a palate of simple red to black fruit, toast and dried herbs. Finishes long with a touch of pepper and grilled meat. The structure provided by balanced tannins and acidity suggest a reward for aging."
"This ageable wine has sturdy tannins and is a shade too young to drink now. A few years of cellaring will open up the blackcurrant and olive flavors and soften the mouthfeel. If you must open it, try with a perfectly grilled lambchop."
"Aromas lean toward black cherry, chocolate and herbs, which sally forth on the palate serving up more dense fruit, licorice, coffee and beautiful toast flavors. Tannins are smooth, supple and ripe. Long, lush and decadent on the finish."
"A beautifully balanced wine, framed in plush, ripe, velvety tannins and backed by lush, black cherry, plum, blackberry, spice, herb and chocolate flavors. Gloriously complex, seamless in its elegance, the wine is packed with charm and personality; long on the finish."
"Ripe, rich and elegant, this wine is brimming with black plum, strawberry, cassis, chocolate, spice and herb notes. It's smooth-textured and seamlessly integrated, even at this early stage. Firm, plush tannins and just the right amount of toasty oak frame the ensemble."
"It's rustic, but there's something balanced and enjoyable in this wine. Combines blackberry and olive notes with some green, stalky flavors that add interest. It's absolutely dry, not just in the official sense, but in the mouth, with a dusting of tannins. Best Buy."
"Rough and earthy, it has some well-developed berry-fruit flavors. High acidity scours the mouth. A serviceable wine, dry and austere, with rasping tannins that aren't likely to soften with age."
"A nice Cabernet, proper and pleasant, it tastes of blackcurrants and oak and is very dry and balanced. No doubting that it comes from a good vineyard and has been made in a competent style."
"Surprisingly rich and complex for this price and the statewide appellation, a full-bodied wine with glorious flavors of blackcurrants. Coats the mouth and lasts through a long finish. The tannins are soft and intricate and add to the enjoyment."
"Epitomizes the New World style of a superripe, soft, plush wine, bursting with fruity-berry flavors, and generously oaked. Hard to imagine a wine flattering the palate more, with its graceful tannins and heaps of blackcurrant, sweet roasted pepper, olive and white chocolate flavors. Instantly appealing, although it may be a difficult match for food."
"A rewarding and satisfying Cab. It may not be in the top tier, but it's close, with voluptuous tannins and classically complex Cab flavors of blackcurrants, olives and herbs. Lacks a bit of concentration in the center, but the pedigree is so good, you'll hardly notice over a grilled ribeye steak."
"Nice wine, and just misses a higher score for a trace of herbaceousness, which is due to the vintage. Otherwise there's some sweet blackcurrant fruit wrapped in fine, velvety tannins, and the touch of smoky oak is just right."
"A fine Cabernet from Sutter Home's upscale line, it shows its pedigree with rich, complex flavors of blackcurrant and sweet olive. The oaky shadings are perfect, and the finish is pure and tasty. Delicious drinking."
"Tastes and smells hot, with a burnt rubber note that persists through the tart, peppery finish. The wine is very dry, with little fruit."
"Really smooth textured. Quite elegant as well, with sleek, complex layers of black currant, blackberry, plum, black cherry, herb, chocolate, coffee, spice, toast and a beguiling hint of tar. The wine is incredibly complex and inviting, framed beautifully in velvety tannins. Long and lush on the finish, it's blended from grapes grown on Mt. Veeder, Atlas Peak and the Napa Valley floor."
"Always reliable, and often a value, this vintage William Hill hits paydirt with well-etched blackcurrant flavors wrapped in a shroud of toasty oak. The dry tannins are dusty and complex, and the wine feels velvety on the palate."
"Pretty good red wine here, nice and juicy, with well-etched flavors of blackberries and tobacco. The texture is especially pleasing and limpid. Needs an extra edge of depth and complexity to hit the big time, but it sure is delicious."
"Stumbles where Santa Barbara Cabs have historically fallen, with green, unripe flavors and tannins and a dry, bitter finish. This wine was not helped by the cool vintage."
"Decent and drinkable, with flavors of blackberries, green olives and sage, and a nice overlay of oak. Very dry, with a good balance of dusty tannins and acidity. Finishes just a bit rough and earthy."
"Not bad for everyday quaffing, with some rich blackberry flavors and nice, dry tannins. It has a country-style edge of roughness to it, but all in all, this is a pretty good value in Cabernet."
"Quite spicy in the nose, with hints of pretty cedar, anise and herb flavors up front. Zippy acidity blends well with creamy smooth tannins, all framing a complex web of chocolate, raspberry, cassis, blackberry, licorice and earth flavors. A slight citrus edge gives lift at the end. Long on the finish; a fine first effort from this new winery. -J.M."
"A lighter style of Napa Cabernet, with pretty spice, cherry, cedar,vanilla, plum and anise notes. Tannins are mild, with medium body. The finish is also moderate in length. -J.M."
"Great structure and balance, among the finest in the world, with all the pedigree that terroir brings to Cabernet. But vintage rules. This harvest, the wine is lean in fruit, with a pepper and sage profile."
"Young and tight and not showing its best now, a cellarworthy wine that's the opposite of today's  flamboyant, drink-me-now style. Possesses elegance and finesse with its curranty flavors and dry, subtle tannins. Drink after 2006."
"This is a country-style Cab, rugged and easy. Provides a pretty good mouthful of blackberry and currant flavor, and is nice and dry. Tough tannins suggest big, rich foods."
"Lots of sun-ripened berry fruit, with smooth tannins and a nice, dry finish, but there's a tart edge of acidity that time won't resolve. Tastes almost like an old Chianti, and best consumed with rich, oily fare."
"Even at six-plus years, and despite its origin in superstar grower's Beckstoffer's vineyards, this Cab has an imbalanced sweetness. The sugariness of the blackberry flavors accentuates the tannins, making them awkward and sharp. Not going anywhere, so drink up."
"Richly textured and plush on the palate, with a broad array of raspberry, black cherry, plum, spice, coffee, herb and cocoa flavors, all couched in firm, ripe tannins and sweet oak. Only 200 cases made from this relatively new producer high in the hills of Napa."
"This complex and distinctive wine is dark and brooding, and reveals itself reluctantly through an elaborate overlay of well-toasted oak. Below all that char and vanilla is polished blackcurrant and cassis fruit. The sweet tannins and weight of the wine are pedigreed, but there's a rawness that demands cellaring. Best beyond 2008."
"There's lots of good varietal character in this pleasant wine. It has correct flavors of blackcurrants, olives and herbs, and is wrapped in delicately soft tannins. The finish is dry and fruity. Not a lot of stuffing going on, but will be nice with roast beef."
"Aging quietly in 70% new French oak, the 2001 is potentially the winery's finest Cherryblock ever. Crammed with berry fruit and tasting softer and plusher than earlier efforts, if the oak integrates into the wine it may merit an even higher score on release."
"Super-sweet, with an enormous blast of sugary blackberries, currants and espresso chocolate or Kahlua. Could use more flavor intensity for the sweetness level."
"Dry, rich and balanced, with dusty tannins and balanced currant, blackberry and oak flavors. A nice, versatile Cabernet with plenty of fanciness that won't break the bank."
"A fine Cab whose balance and slight earthiness will enhance, not swamp, food. Delicately structured, with cherry, cassis, oak and tobacco flavors, and rich tannins."
"This Cabernet has rich blackberry-jam and black licorice flavors, and it also has a funky bacon note. The oak provides a pleasant backdrop of sweet toast. This shows how well Cabernet can perform on the far Sonoma Coast, which is now  more oriented to Pinot Noir."
"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009."
"Norman Conquest, get it? The wine itself is too soft, and lacks the tannin-acid structure needed for balance. Too bad, because the oak-infused cherry and blackberry flavors are fine."
"Tastes more like a Zin than a Cab, with rustic tannins and a peppery, briary flavor of wild berries. The wine is dry, but way too soft for any development, so drink now."
"Not very successful, especially at this price. It's showing the weaknesses of Paso Cabernet. Although there's obviously ripe fruit, the wine has an awkward mouthfeel, with semisweet fruit flavors that finish with a green, peppermint jelly note."
"Soft and dull, with blackberry and cherry jam and sweet vanilla flavors. The tannins and acids both are low. Not going anywhere."
"The estate vineyard is in Calistoga, and the wine shows gorgeously ripe flavors but never loses its basic Napa elegance and balance. Filled with flamboyant blackberry jam, cherry, cassis, licorice, chocolate and smoky vanilla-oak flavors, it appeals immediately to the tastebuds, but has the tannin-acid balance to age for a decade."
"Soft, smooth and elegant in texture, savory in flavor, this Central Coast Cab tastes of cherries, cassis, mocha and licorice. Smoky oak turns up on the finish. Forward enough to drink now, but it should hold for a couple of years."
"What's so nice about this Cab is its balance and delicacy, without the heaviness that can mar a more alcoholic wine. It shows polished flavors of cherries, blackberries, cola and cedar, with a long, fine finish of cassis liqueur. Really an elegant sipper, this wine is best now and for a couple years."
"This is always a drily tannic wine in its youth, but it's also one of the most ambitious Cabs produced from Dry Creek Valley, and is worth attention. With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet. Four-plus years of age have softened them. Drink this Cabernet Sauvignon now with very upscale foods, and it should hold and soften for a decade."
"The official alcohol is under 14%, but the wine smells and tastes like Port. It has a burnt, caramelized taste of baked fruit, and is tannicly astringent."
"Solidly in the Hillside Select model, this vigorous young Cab is dramatically ripe and powerful. The flavors of red and black currants, milk chocolate, figs and smoky vanilla erupt in the mouth, making the tastebuds jump with joy. However, there is also the structure, among the greatest in California Cabs. The acidity is fine, but the tannins are stupendously rich, sweet and complex, practically a food group in themselves. Stunning and gorgeous now in its youth, this collectible wine will reward at least through 2015."
"Four-plus years haven't helped to soften or sweeten this tough, herbal Cab. It's bone dry and lean, even austere in flavor, leaving the alcohol and powerful tannins to dominate."
"This Cab already has nearly five years on it, but it still has tough, bitter tannins. That raises the question: will it age? Fruit-wise, it's rich in blackberries, cherries and currants, with an exotic cassis finish. The acidity is crisp and zesty. But those acids and tannins are likely to outlive the fruit."
"Built for the cellar, this Cab is impressively deep in ripe currant, cherry, cocoa, milk chocolate and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a brittle astringency, and sweet in oak and fruit on the finish. Best after 2008, and for some years after."
"Off by a few beats from the '02, the '03 shows red currant, plumped raisin and green mint jelly notes. The flavors are good, but the wine, which is soft in structure, is not an ager."
"Unusual for a 2003 Cab to be held back this long before release. Maybe they thought the tannins were too strong. They're fully resolved now, but the fruit has faded, leaving behind mild flavors of dried cherries, currants and herbs that finish very dry. It's an elegant wine, rather than a voluptuous one."
"Although this Cab is nearly seven years old, it's still hard and tough in tannins, and the tart acidity suggests it will remain unbalanced for the rest of its life. If you can get past the sharpness, it has dry flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants."
"This is dry and slightly herbal, with sage and dill notes to the cherry and blackberry flavors. But it's those Alexander Valley tannins, so soft and mellow, that mark it. Good now, and should ride out the next eight years."
"They kept this Cab back all this time, presumably at some cost to the company, but consumers are the beneficiaries. Everything has mellowed. The wine, with 1% Petit Verdot, is like hands of cassis, dark chocolate and oak massaging the palate. The grapes were sourced from top vineyards in the Dry Creek, Sonoma and Alexander Valleys. Drink now–2010."
"Sharp and jammy, with blackberry, cherry and black raspberry flavors that finish dry and tannic. It's all upfront, so drink now."
"Here's a beautifully structured young Cabernet, blended with a little Merlot, that has turned soft and generous enough after five years to drink now. Yet it shows a complex depth that will enable it to age for a few more years. It is, in a word, delicious, with black currant, black cherry pie, orange zest, cocoa and spicy, smoky oak nuances."
"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both."
"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008–2010."
"With polished blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this affordable Cab represents a good value. It's soft, dry and stylish, and easy to drink."
"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it."
"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade."
"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure. New oak adds just the right touch of smoke and vanilla to this ageworthy 100% Cab. Best after 2010."
"This winery seems to be trying to find an identity. The Cabs are vintage-driven, and do better in cool years, which 2004 wasn't. This wine is a little soft and direct, but delicious enough, with ripe, pastry-filling blackberry, cherry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors. You can taste high-char oak on the finish."
"Good structure in this Cab, with firm tannins and fine acidity, but it lacks richness, especially at this price. There's a minty green sharpness next to the black currant flavors, making it feel unripe and unbalanced."
"Shows those classic, old-fashioned Howell Mountain tannins that lock the wine down and make it more or less undrinkable in youth. There are some good black currant flavors, but they're not really powerful, and have herbal notes alongside. That makes the future of this wine a question."
"Smells raisiny-Porty, and turns dry and austere in the mouth, with modest currant and oak flavors set off by hard tannins. The official alcohol is only 14.9%, but the wine feels hotter than that."
"There's still a sharpness to this wine, even though it's nearly 4 years old. It shows good blackberry, currant and chocolate-covered cherry flavors, but also a greener streak of mint and oregano that probably limits its ageability."
"Sharp and medicinal, with the taste of plastic bandages and cherry-mint candies; very tannic."
"Excessively ripe fruit verging on baked, burnt blackberries, hard tannins and residual sweetness."
"Really too ripely sweet and hot for comfort, even though the alcohol is only 14%. Tastes like oven-baked cherries and blackberries, with lots of caramel."
"Fans of CC will find a wine with the balance of previous vintages. It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins. Not a long-term ager, but should hold for 6 years, and is easy to find, with more than 13,000 cases produced."
"This is the winery's flagship wine, the one that made it famous decades ago. It hasn't changed much over the years. It's still tannic and austere in youth, requiring many years to develop. But it's a cellar guarantee, with a wealth of concentrated cassis and cedar flavors that are just waiting for those tannins to drop out. Best after 2010."
"The vineyard has been source to several wineries including Conn Creek, who had a successful 2002, but this '04 is a let-down. Despite some decent black currant and oak flavors the wine feels tannicly sharp and astringent, without charming softness, and does not seem capable of improving in the cellar."
"This is the least successful Judd's Hill Cabernet in recent memory. The current '04 bottling is lean, with cherry tea and mint flavors. A disappointment."
"Carneros isn't ideal for Cabernet, as it's too cool. Even in this hot vintage, Truchard's '04 bottling has an unripe, vegetal streak beside the cassis, chocolate and new oak flavors."
"Not as rich or chewy as the Diamond Mountain Ranch bottling, Sterling's 2004 Reserve Cabernet is immediately accessible, offering aromas and flavors of cassis and dried spices and soft tannins. A good steak house red."
"A pretty nice young Cab, though the weather was too hot and the wine is deficient in acidity. But the flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and new oak are delicious, and the tannins are smooth and silky."
"Just barely acceptable, this soft, semisweet Cab has Lifesaver candy flavors of cherries and raspberries."
"This wine shows very ripe flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, cassis, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak, and is balanced with a nice bite of acidity and tannin."
"This is a limited production 100% Cab from the winery's estate vineyard. It's much more tannic than Cohn's extraordinarily fine '04 Estate, which was released a year ago. Even at the age of five-plus, it stings with sandpapery astringency. Should easily negotiate the years, with its massive core of blackberries, black currants, olives and 100% new oak. Hold until after 2010, and should develop for many years beyond."
"It may be that this wine needs time in the cellar, but right now, it's tough and tannic. There are some fine blackberry, cassis, spicy plum and cedar flavors, and it could blossom after 2008 for a few years."
"Ripe and expressive, with a gentle, velvety mouthfeel, this is marked by some firm, dry tannins that suggest moderate aging. There's some good spicy cherry and blackberry flavor, along with the sweet vanilla and cedar from considerable new oak."
"Adelaida's basic Paso Cab is delicious and charming, a wine to enjoy with grilled meats or even a simple roast chicken. Direct in blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, it finishes a little sweet."
"This is Baldacci's regular Cab, although most wineries would be content for it to be their reserve. It's a powerful, rich young wine, massive in blackberry, currant and oak flavors, with a succulent edge of milk chocolate. The tannins are pure Stags Leap, giving a complex contrapuntal balance of grip and structure to the opulent fruit. Just fabulous in every aspect, a wine to dazzle. Drink now through 2010, at least."
"The grapes come from three vineyards: Georges III in Rutherford, Tokalon in Oakville and Stagecoach, up on Atlas Peak. That helps explain the wine's beauty. It's pure California, cult-style Cab, soft and generous, with voluptuously ripe black currant and black cherry flavors elaborately enriched with spicy, smoky, 100% new French oak. My only quibble is that it could use a little more subtlety."
"Just released after nearly eight years, this wine still tastes lively and timely. It's marked by complex waves of blackberries, mocha, currants, cola and spices, although the fruit is beginning to move into drier, secondary characteristics. It's delicious, and fully ready to drink now. Give it a decanting, and watch as it changes in the glass."
"A very distinctive 100% Cab that some might even find controversial. It's ripe almost to the point of supermaturity, showing powerful currant and licorice flavors that are very well oaked. Finishes hard in tannins in its youth. Aims, with some success, at an extracted, modern or cult style."
"Tasted in a flight of other '04 Rutherford Cabs, this one was a little leaner and greener. There's a pepperminty sharpness alongside the cherry and cedar flavors. Best now and for a few years."
"Ripe, soft and forward in pie-filling blackberry, cherry, dark chocolate and spice flavors, this has rich, earthy tannins. Drink now–2010."
"When this hilly vineyard Cab first came out, it was very good, but quality has slipped over the years. The '04 is perfectly decent in oak-infused blackberry and currant flavors and rich tannins, and it may even improve for a few years."
"The most structured of Sterling's recent releases and hence our favorite, the 2004 Diamond Mountain Ranch Cabernet boasts notes of cinnamon, cassis and clove, framed by firm tannins and finishing with a hint of anise. Drink 2008–2015."
"This is certainly dramatic in structure, akin to a young Pauillac from Bordeaux, with concentrated currant, cherry, pencil lead and cedar flavors wrapped into youthfully hard tannins. It needs time, and should soften with increased complexity by 2009. Could reward with even longer cellaring, but '04 was not a great vintage."
"A lush Cabernet that feels soft and delicious right now, but has layers of complexity that make it a cellar candidate. Dry and oaky, the wine is enormously rich in blackberry, cassis, cocoa and cedar flavors, with considerable tannins. The wine is wonderfully balanced. Drink now through 2010, at least."
"The Rutherford vineyard has been the source of well-regarded Cabs for Monticello and the '04 is the latest. Compact and ageworthy, it shows well-ripened blackberry, cherry and cola flavors that have been generously oaked. The tannins are firm and sticky now, suggesting development. Best 2008–2012."
"With its sticky tannins and hard finish, this wine wants a few years in the cellar. It's quite good, showing a crisp spine of acidity that firms and tones the ripe black currant, cherry liqueur and cedar flavors."
"Softly tannic and dry, with a punch of acidity, this Cab has fully developed flavors of red and black currants, raisins, mocha and cinnamon spice. Drink it now with barbecue."
"Grown in Rutherford, this 100% Cab may strike some as old-fashioned. It's bone dry, firm in acids and tannins, and the grapes evidently were not left on the vines until they were partially shrivelled. You can tell, because there's an earthy, green olive edge to the blackberry fruit flavors. But that's what makes this wine so fine and food-friendly."
"Spring Mountain Cabs typically are hard in youth but not this one, to which all the techniques of early drinkability seem to have been applied. The tannins are here, bigtime, but so finely grained you can drink the wine tonight. Flavorwise, there's nothing unusual about the ripe cassis and oak flavors; what's distinctive about this Cab is its dignified balance and finesse. Drink now through 2014."
"For 40 bucks, this is a sumptuous, lush young wine that offers all the fancy fruit and oak you expect from an upscale Napa Cab."
"The vineyard, on Spring Mountain, has been the source of very good Cabs from both Marston and Beringer, and the '04 continues that tradition. Made in the modern style, this is soft and very ripe to the point of sweetness. But it pulls back at the last minute, allowing the cassis, chocolate and red cherry flavors to finish dry. Best with something simple, like a grilled steak."
"The term “Rutherford Bench” is not a legal one, but colloquially refers to the west side of Highway 29, where the wines, supposedly, are better. And this is quite a good wine. It's fresh and young in sweet tannins and acidity; everything's not quite integrated yet, but it's a big, rich, complexly balanced wine. Should come into its own by 2008, then hold for some years."
"Simple, soft and jammy, with baked cherry pie, currant and milk chocolate flavors. There's a bitterness throughout. Drink now."
"Dry and smoothly tannic, the blackberry flavors have a softly herbal, earthy tinge. There's a lot of new oak, possibly too much, because the smoky caramel is just a bit overpowering."
"This is a big, powerful wine, packed with flavor. It's very good, even succulent, and startles with the intensity of its fruit, but has an edge of overripe raisins that may limit ageability. With firm tannins, the tastes suggest baked, pastry-filling blackberries, mulberries and currants."
"Very unusual to get a newly released Cabernet from the 2004 vintage, especially one this good, at this price. At age six, it's fully mellow, with a silky mouthfeel framing flavors of cherries and blackberries that are starting to dry out and sweeten. There are also developing notes of mushrooms and earth. What a bargain, but only 800 cases were produced."
"The wine is 100% Cabernet, a combination of the winery's Palisades vineyard, in Calistoga, and Graveyard Hill, in Carneros. Strangely, it's not as good as either of those single-vineyard bottlings. It's too ripe, with stewed berry and raisin flavors that are almost Port-like."
"This is a big, rich, flashy Cab. It's very ripe, brimming with jammy blackberry, currant, chocolate-covered raisin and spicy olive flavors. Drinks soft and opulent in instant appeal, but doesn't seem like a longterm ager. Best now through 2010."
"This is a tough wine in two ways. It's rather hard and brittle in acids and tannins now, and it's also tough to predict its future. It's rich in currant, blackberry jam, coffee and cedar flavors, but there is an undertow of raisins that could compromise its longterm viability."
"Aged for more than two years in new oak, this 100% Cab bursts with smoky vanilla and char that currently dominate its underlying fruit. But it's likely that time in the bottle will meld everything together. The powerful black currant, black cherry, carob and tobacco flavors, wrapped into rich, soft tannins, suggest holding at least through 2008, and the wine should develop well for a decade."
"Strong and direct in licorice, cassis, cocoa and smoky cedar flavors, the wine is balanced with adequate acids. It's also thoroughly dry, a good thing. Could use a bit more polish in the tannic structure, which is on the jagged side. Decant, or age for two or three years."
"Corley builds its reserve Cab for the long haul. The wine is too tannic to enjoy now, numbing the palate with dry astringency. But there's great depth here, to judge by the wealth of black currant flavor that's accented by rich new oak. Cellar this puppy until at least 2008, and it should hit its prime from 2010 and for many years after."
"A very nice Cab, rich and textured and soft, with intricate flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants, mocha and toasty, smoky oak and vanilla. Notable for its tannins, which are very fine. Great now and through 2012 or so."
"A good Cabernet for the table, with its dryness, firm tannins and general balance. Shows deep, long-lasting flavors of black currants, anise and smoky cedar, and could even develop some bottle complexity."
"Crisp acids and finely ground tannins give this young Cab great structure, making it feel balanced and elegant. It's also a very ripe wine, showing lush blackberry, cassis and cherry flavors. The wine is big enough to easily support its significant amount of flashy new oak. Drink now through 2010."
"A very nice Cabernet, with a rich vein of tannins that gives it a crunchy texture, and forward black currant, cherry, and plum flavors that are as juicy as they come. Nearly 100% varietal Cab, it feels upscale and plush in the mouth, and gets better as it warms in the glass. Fair price for a Cab this good."
"Still young and tight at the age of 4-plus, with an astringency marked by tannins and acids and a bone-dry, somewhat scoury-bitter finish. Good, but could be in a slump at this point in time. Might improve in a year or so."
"This is a nice, plush Cabernet, soft and sweet in blackberry, currant and chocolate fruit flavors, but it's not a classic example of Mount Veeder Cabs, which are usually drier and more tannic. Drink in the short term."
"The opening scent of funky, sweaty leather is not promising, and indeed, it tastes overly soft and muted. You can sense some good fruit in there, but it's tamped down. The tannins stick out, making the wine awkward and common."
"This is a great vineyard that has sourced great Cabs for Terra Valentine. A barrel sample of the '04, tasted more than 2 years ago, showed ageability. Now that it has been released, the wine is still very young and filled with potential. Thick in black currants, cherries and oak, it needs much more time. Best after 2010."
"Far Niente has produced a tannic, drily astringent young wine that's nowhere near ready to drink. It's tough as nails, with a gritty astringency that locks down the black currant and dark, unsweetened chocolate flavors. But it is a very balanced, distinguished wine that should easily negotiate the next 10 or 15 years, with proper cellaring."
"Summers has been quietly perfecting Cabernet under the radar. The '04 continues a string of successful vintages. It's riper and more accessible than previous years, and rewards for expressive black currant flavors enhanced with lots of fine, smoky new oak. The tannins are so gentle, you can drink this wine now, but it should hold for a good six years."
"Thin and raw, and slightly sweet, this is not a very satisfying Cab. It tastes like candied blackberry and cherry LifeSavers."
"A bit herbal and earthy, with some green tannins, this 100% Cab was mostly grown in the Mayacamas Mountains overlooking Sonoma Valley. It's dry and soft, with suggestions of cherries, blackberries and currants."
"This 100% Cab will strike some cult Cabernet addicts as old-fashioned. It's  bone dry and firm in tannins, with an herb and olive tapenade taste to the riper currants and blackberries. Virtually guaranteed to age, this elegant young wine should be best between 2010 and 2016."
"This is a gorgeous Cabernet, but it's pretty young, and while it's delicious now due to the ripe fruit, it really needs time. Wrapped in fresh, tight tannins, it displays powerful red and black currant, blackberry, cherry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, and shows the elegant, important mouthfeel of a top Napa Cab. Give it until after 2008, if you can keep your hands off, and will come into its own after 2010."
"This is Clos Pegase's basic, least expensive Cabernet, but it shows the effort proprietor Jan Shrem has put into the winery and vineyards over the years. It's quite a good wine, rich with gorgeous tannins framing ripe currant, cassis, chocolate and licorice flavors. At its best now and for a few years, this 100% Cab is, in a word, luscious."
"Bright and forward in red and black cherry, plum and new oak aromas, this lush Bordeaux blend comes from two small vineyards in St. Helena. It has a smooth, silky texture, very seductive and charming. Luscious now, but has the structural integrity to age through 2012."
"Kudos to Azalea Springs for bottling this with a screwtop. The vineyard is between St. Helena and Calistoga, at the foot of Diamond Mountain. It has mountain-sized tannins, making it astringently hard. It also has a solid core of blackberry and black currant fruit. This is not one of your soft, gentle cult Cabs, it's one that demands cellaring. Best 2010–2014."
"The vineyard, long a source for Beringer's Cabs, is in the north-central valley, east of the Silverado Trail, just below Howell Mountain. It shows the hard, tough tannins of Cabs from that neck of the woods. Flavors of red currants, cherries and cocoa are rich and vibrant, but the wine is too astringent to open now. Hold until after 2010, and it should develop for an additional 6–8 years."
"From a vineyard north of St. Helena comes this 100% varietal wine. If you like your Cabs soft, superextracted and direct, you'll love it. The blackberry and cherry flavors are so ripe and sweet, they taste like pie filling. Best now and for a couple years."
"Here's a solid value that shows true Napa style. Dry and balanced, it offers up rich flavors of cherries, blackberries and spice, wrapped into smooth tannins."
"A good wine for its classic structure and deep, complex black currant and cocoa flavors. But it's pretty oaky and tannic, giving it a hard, resistant feeling despite being nearly four years in age. Could surprise with up to 6 years in the cellar."
"A real success story for this hot vintage. Feels gracious and generous in the mouth, offering complex, fat flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and cedar that turn spicy on the finish. The tannins are elaborately ripe and fine. The well-known vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, and production was 2,300 cases. Drinkable now, and should age well for at least a decade."
"Heavy and soft, with firm tannins. You'll find modest currant fruit, with a harsh, raisiny finish."
"This is a limited-production line from this venerable winery. It's a very dense, focused Cab, a little too tightly wound to pop the cork quite yet. There's a sharp pine or balsam zinginess that's a combination of smoky oak and deeply ripe cassis, fresh and zesty and dry. The wine needs time for all this to mellow. Best after 2008, and for a decade beyond."
"Other wineries have produced very good vineyard-designated Cabs from this mountain property. Now Brandlin has a go, and the wine shows promise. It's considerably more tannic than most expensive New Age Napa Cabs, so dry and astringent that it demands cellar time. But it should develop, to judge from the powerful core of black currant fruit. Best after 2008 and through 2012, at least."
"The vineyard is up in the Mayacamas between Spring Mountain and Sonoma Valley, and the wine shows quite a bit of power. Coming from this hot vintage, it's also very ripe and fruity, in a California way. But it's classically structured and dry, and the tannins are softly complex. This delicious, ageable Cab is a worthy followup to the '03."
"Those mountain tannins are here in spades, and even though they're ripe and sweet, they give the wine a powerful astringency that demands cellaring. But age will certainly reward, for the wine is huge in currant, black cherry and unsweetened chocolate flavors. Open after 2010 and the fruit will shine through in all its ripe, succulent glory."
"This wine is soft with some nice layers, and delicious in blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and smoky oak flavors that finish dry, with a scour of sweet tannins."
"An interesting wine. It comes from a southerly part of Napa Valley many consider too cool for fine Cab. But this was a warm vintage. The result is very ripe fruit, wrapped in robust, hard tannins that make the wine too young to drink now. The blackberry, currant, cherry and new oak flavors are delicious, but this Cab needs at least through 2008 to come into its own, and will be better after 2010."
"Tastes soft and a little tired at the age of six-plus years, with pie-filling raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. A certain dry complexity makes it interesting, but its lifespan is largely exhausted."
"We all wonder if those cult Cabs will age, but there's no doubt that this is a cellar guarantee. Cathy Corison makes her Cabs less ripe than many others, so the alcohol is lower and the acids and tannins are harder and drier. That's in youth. But such is the depth of cherry, blackberry, cassis, cedar and mineral flavors and overall balance that this complex young wine should easily negotiate the next 15 years."
"All the parts of this juvenile wine have not begun to come together. You have ripe, jammy blackberry, cassis and blueberry flavors, firm tannins, evident new oak, and crisp acidity. All they need is time to marry. The wine is 100% Cabernet, and the grapes used to be vineyard-designated by Beringer. Cellar until at least late 2008, and the wine should improve for many years."
"Here's one to put away for a while. Even though the warm vintage coaxed out oodles of black currants, blackberry and cherry pie filling, red plum and dry, unsweetened chocolate flavors, the wine has a tannic intensity that makes it a bit astringent. But it's balanced and well-structured, so cellar, and should be best 2009–2012."
"Here's a Cab that makes a play for supremecy in a very crowded field. The wine, which contains a drop of Merlot, is solidly in the modern, international, Napa cult style. Soft and appealing for its blackberry, currant, plum and vanilla oak flavors, it's drinkable now, but such are the tannins that it will be better after 2008."
"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least."
"I really liked the past releases of this wine, but the '04 is not in the same league. It's a hot wine, with baked or stewed fruit flavors, and finishes with prickly, drily astringent tannins. Not going anywhere, so drink now."
"Amicus has been doing a good job over the years producing richly intense mountain-style Cabs. This one, from a warm vintage, is very ripe, showing lusty red and black currant flavors. The tannins are thick, but sweet and fine, making the wine instantly drinkable, although decanting won't hurt. Best now–2010."
"Here's one for the cellar. You could drink it now, with a little decanting, but such is the structural youth that you'd miss this Bordeaux blend at its best. Rich and savory in spicy black and red currant, cherry and cedar flavors, the wine shows a firm tannic structure, with a crisp bite of acidity. Hold until late 2008; should evolve over the next six to eight years."
"This is a second wine from Palmaz. It's a big Cabernet, dry and full-bodied, with extravagant cassis, cherry and oak flavors that contain riper notes of red currants and licorice. Gets better as it sits in the glass and breathes, and could benefit from up to five years in the cellar."
"Balance and complexity are the hallmarks of this Cab from veteran producer Hanna. It's deep and long in spicy, oaky blackberry and cherry fruit, while the structure is defined by soft tannins and good acids. Delicious now, and should hold for a decade."
"Made very much in the modern cult style, this is an enormously rich, soft, immediately delicious wine, with a milk chocolate edge to the blackberry, cherry and new oak flavors. It's not an ager; drink now."
"Ripe and fleshy in young fruit, this Cab, with minor amounts of Cab Franc and Merlot, shows black currant, plum, cherry and cedar flavors, with a dry-sweet dusting of crushed brown herbs and spices. Fairly tannic and tight now, it's balanced enough for mid-term aging. Best 2008–2012."
"More tannic than in previous vintages, and not as immediately rich, this Cab-dominated Bordeaux blend will benefit from decanting. It needs some air to open up and reveal its heart of cassis. Will develop with six or so years of aging, but doesn't seem like a longterm cellar candidate."
"This is a pretty good Cab, as far as it goes. It tastes a bit sharp, with very ripe blackberry and currant flavors that have a baked fruit quality. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink now."
"This is very appealing for the soft, sexy texture and drink-me-now black currant flavors, but it's lacking the acid-tannin structure that great Napa Cab needs. Drink now and for a few years."
"Simple, easy and balanced, this crowd-pleasing Cab will satisfy for its wealth of ripe fruit and oak flavors. Floods the mouth with cassis, licorice and melted milk chocolate, wrapped in smooth, gentle tannins."
"This is a much more oaky version of the winery's Game Ranch regular bottling, which was released two years ago. The original release was very ripe in fruit but very tannic. This one's the same, but plastered with new oak."
"This is the sweetest, jammiest of Fogarty's '04 Cabs, and also the the tartest. It has the fruit acidity sharpness of cherry and black raspberry jam, as well as a firm tannic structure. Could develop bottle complexity over the years, but there's a certain thinness that raises eyebrows."
"Soft and simple, this Cab has the benefit of dryness and an elegant structure. But the flavors are a little thin, suggesting modest currants and cherries, overlaid with sweet, smoky oak. Good for everyday purposes."
"Soft in structure and slightly herbal, this polished wine has flavors of blackberries, cherries, tobacco, cocoa and leather. Drink now."
"Better known as a Zinfandel house, Sausal can sometimes surprise with their richly soft, intricately layered Cabs, and the '04 is just that. It's immediately likeable for the wealth of blackberries, chocolate, cedar and spice. Best now and soon."
"A disappointment. After a string of better vintages, Titus' 2004 Cab had a funky, reduced aroma, and tasted strangely flat and muted, with lots of smoky oak. Tasted twice, with consistent results."
"There's a lot to praise and also lots to criticize in this Cab. It's richly tannic and nicely oaked, with lush black currant and smoky oak flavors. But it also has a harshness that interferes with enjoyment. Doesn't seem likely to age out."
"A bit inert, with muted aromas and a heavy, tannic mouthfeel. Feels hot and peppery in the mouth. The flavors of black currants give way to a sweet vanilla, tannic finish."
"Here's one for the cellar, not just because the tannins are so aggressive, but because the wine is so balanced. With alcohol only 13.8%, it's dry and rich in black currant fruit, almost a throwback to the Napa Cabernets of old that aged so well. It possesses a dry, elegant sophistication that stands in deliberate contrast to today's gooey, sweet style. Best 2009–2015, if not longer, with proper cellaring."
"The blazing vintage took its toll on this high altitude wine. It tastes of baked pie-filling cherries and blackberries, with a hot, burnt middle palate, even though the official alcohol reading is a modest 13.8%."
"Too ripe and obvious in fruit, with raisin, currant and black cherry jam flavors, accented with smoky, caramelized oak. Good and rich, but lacks subtlety. Drink now."
"Based on the old 100% Cabs from Inglewood that aged forever, Rubicon's interpretation has the same hard, tough tannins in youth. It's not a wine you want to drink anytime soon. Bursting with cherry, blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, it has the elegant balance needed for ageability. Best after 2010, and should hold and improve for many years after."
"A new bottling from the winery, made from vines grown 2,000 feet up the mountain that were planted only in 2001. It's far too immature to drink now or anytime soon. The tannins are thick and on lockdown, the blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit all primary and not yet integrated with the oak. But these parts are high-quality and need time to mesh and develop. Best after 2010 through 2016 and beyond."
"This high-end Cab is named after a deceased winery employee who would be pleased to have such a distinguished wine in his memory. It's very powerful and tannic and needs age, but it's also exceptionally balanced. Showing ripe red and black currant flavors that have been generously oaked, it's a gorgeous young Napa Valley Cab that should develop through 2014."
"Shows the impeccable balance you expect from this master winemaker, even in this hot vintage, where supermaturity was a challenge. The wine is certainly ripe, offering a mouthful of blackberries, cherries and currants. But it never loses its elegant tannin-acid architecture. Beautiful now, and should develop through 2014."
"One of the ripest, highest alcohol Mondavi Reserve Cabs in memory, this wine is forward in cassis and cherry flavors, and while the tannins are pretty sturdy, it's sweet and soft enough to drink now. It definitely has the rich mouthfeel you want in a pricey Napa Cab. But it's young; cellar this one until at least 2010."
"Okay for barbecue, but kind of simple and soft in structure, and sweet. It shows candied flavors of a chocolate-covered blackberry and cherry power bar with nougat and honey-roasted nuts."
"Despite nearly 16% alcohol, this wine manages not to taste hot. The fruit is so powerful, and the tannins so smooth, that it gives a balanced and harmonious mouthfeel. The flavors are a peacock's tail of pure red cherries, red currants and licorice, with a sweet finish of cassis. Should remain enjoyable through 2010."
"The grapes for this interesting and compelling Cab come from all over the county, including Russian River Valley, Rockpile and the Mayacamas Mountains. The winemaker's blending expertise shows in the wine's delicious balance. Dry and zesty, it shows classic flavors of black currants, cedar and plums, with a rich, complex finish of dusty spices."
"Goldschmidt released their 2004 Vyborny Cab nearly 2 years ago, and it was terrific. This PLUS bottling has not been explained by the winery, but seems to be a reserve-style selection of the wine, and a lot oakier. The wine is extremely ripe in blackberries and cherries, while the oak adds sweeter vanilla and caramel flavors that do not really add to the original release."
"Likeable for its balance and varietal richness, this 100% Cab is rich in blackberry and cherry fruit, while considerable oak adds a savory jacket of vanilla, toast and cedar-spice. Really defines the elegance and polish of its terroir, and should hold and improve for eight years."
"There's a spicy quality to the aroma of this polished Cab, with suggestions of dill, sage, crushed autumn leaves and even Provençal lavender and thyme. It's a unique interpretation of Napa and must come from the vineyard's terroir. In the mouth, notes of herbs and tobacco lead to more savory sweet cherry, currant and vanilla oak flavors. This interesting, even dramatic Cab should develop over the next decade."
"Good flavors of ripe berries, cherries and spices, with a dose of new smoky oak, but there's a certain flatness to the mouthfeel. Some of the life is gone, and the wine turns sweet and raisiny on the finish. Drink now."
"This Reserve requires the faith of a true believer in its future. It's awkward now, a tannic, very new-oaky wine with jammy black currant flavors, and seems all over the place. We know from long experience that CDV Cabs age terrifically, and this one might. Best after 2012, and could improve a great   deal."
"At the age of more than seven years, this wine is getting tired. It's drying out and softening, with mellow tannins and raisiny flavors that testify to the heat of the vintage. Drink up."
"Does just what you want a Cab at this price to do, offering soft, immediate pleasure with extra points for complex elegance. You'll find cassis, cherry, sage and cedar flavors wrapped into ripely sweet tannins, with a finish of authority."
"A very nice approximation of Raymond's more expensive Napa Cabernets, this one shows blackberry and currant flavors, with a rich layer of smoky oak and a dry, smooth finish."
"A little hot and tannic, with a young Port feeling, except that the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, is totally dry. Hard to tell where it's going. Grown in Yountville."
"This is a very lush Cab, made in the modern style. All the elements of cult Cab are there: the soft voluptuousness, the finely ground, sweet tannins, the immensely ripe currant, blackberry and cocoa flavors, the coating of fine, smoky oak. I don't think it's an ager because of the softness and ripeness."
"Will it age? That's the question for this Cab, from a winery better known for Monterey Chardonnay. Right now it's a bit sharp and obvious, with ultra-ripe, jammy berry-cherry and chocolate flavors and firm tannins. But the balance seems to be there. If you don't want to cellar it, enjoy with barbecue."
"A little minty, with a clove and pepper edge to the black currant, carob and cedar flavors, but nice and dry, with a firm structure. Doesn't seem like an ager."
"A brittle, peppery and ultimately disappointing wine, this 100% varietal lacks the smoothness and cherry-herb complexities you expect from a fine Rutherford Cab. Finishes sharp and dry."
"There's a drily tannic texture that gives this very ripe Cab structure and balance. Thoroughly dry, it tastes of red and black currants, smoky oak and peppery, dusty Asian spices. Gets better and better as it unfolds in the glass."
"A beautiful Cab, ripe and lush, that defines the modern style of Oakville. With soft but complex tannins, its flavors are classic Cab, showing cassis and licorice, with a gorgeous overlay of smoky oak. Right up there with the best of them, the grapes were grown from a single vineyard at the Vine Hill Ranch."
"There's a softness to this dry wine. It's forward and rich in currants and smoky oak, but could use greater acidity. The tannins also seem a little ungainly, although they could mellow out in a few years."
"Chimney Rock had 3 Bordeaux-style wines from the '04 vintage, and this reserve is not only the priciest, but the best. It shows the appealing blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit and oak of the Elevage bottling, but also is tannicly balanced enough for the cellar. Good now for its complexity, but should peak around 2010, then hold through 2015."
"Very dark, rich in oak and extracted in fruit, this Cab has enormous flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. It's a little sharp in acidity all through the finish, which gives it a sting."
"A little too ripe, with jammy raspberry, cherry, blackberry and Dr. Pepper flavors that have a pie-filling sweetness. Other than that, structurally, the wine has smooth, ripe tannins and a lush coating of oak."
"With ripe blackberry, currant and cassis flavors accented with smoky oak, this Cab is a bit soft and direct in the mouth. It's a rich wine, but not particularly complex. Drink now."
"Here's the latest in a string of great Cabs from Vine Cliff. It shows the full ripeness of the vintage, with a rich array of blackberry, cassis, cherry, chocolate and caramel flavors. But it wisely preserves structure with fine acidity and a complex tannic architecture. Should develop well over the next 10 years."
"This is an enormously ripe, sumptuous Cabernet Sauvignon. It has all the hallmarks of the modern cult style, from focused blackberry, cassis and spicy chocolate flavors and profoundly ripe, sweet tannins to the balancing acidity and oak elaboration that adds that extra touch of richness. This elegant wine is at its best now and for five years."
"Tastes as sweet as jam, namely the raspberry, cherry and blackberry kind, with melted chocolate and anise stirred in for good measure. Fortunately, adequate acidity provides much-needed balance. Drink now."
"Duckhorn has an absolutely consistent track record with this bottling from St. Helena, and there's no way they're stopping now. The 2004 is riper and softer than its predecessors, but no less rewarding. It shows elaborately ripe black currant, cherry, chocolate, cedar and violet flavors, and is very well oaked, just oozing vanilla caramel. Drink now or soon."
"This is the kind of wine the late, great André Tchelistcheff described as an iron fist in a velvet glove. The glove is the lush, forward blackberry, currant and cocoa flavors, the smooth texture and the seductively sweet new oak. The fist is the sheer power. This is an important addition to the pantheon of Stags Leap Cabernet Sauvignon, and one that needs some time in the cellar."
"Diamond Mountain, on the Mayacamas side of Napa Valley, has long been known for producing Cabs that possess hard tannins in their youth. Not this one. Modern tannin management has yielded a lush, lusciously soft wine, beguiling in blackberry and cherry pie filling and mocha flavors that are almost sweet. But the finish is thoroughly dry."
"Tastes jellied with LifeSaver candy flavors of blackberries and cherries. This one is good, but far less interesting, than Baldacci's '04 Cab."
"This bottling has been variable over the years, and the '04 is not showing it at its best. It's a good but not a great Cabernet, ripe and a little sweet in cassis and cherry flavors, backed up with firm, dry tannins. Drink now."
"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years."
"Give this Cab extra points for the dazzle factor. It shows the most beautifully ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, and a powerful but tasty coating of smoky oak. The tannins are so sweet and fine, but the excessive softness robs the wine of structure."
"At the age of more than eight years, this 100% Cabernet remains powerful with blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's just starting to show bottle complexity, with the tannins softening and the fruit gaining earthy tones. A criticism is the alcohol, which is high and doesn't seem to lose its heat. Drink now."
"Wattle Creek has done a good job with Cabernet over the years, and here's another one. I don't think '04 was their best vintage, as the wine is a little raisiny, despite an official alcohol of only 14.1%. But it shows a classy structure, polished dryness and a good depth of varietal black currant fruit, accented with new oak. Probably best now and for a few years."
"Nice structure on this dry, smooth Cab, which is made in the modern cult style of soft, immediate likeability. The blackberry, cassis, cherry and oak flavors are appealing. But at this price, you have a right to demand more depth and complexity."
"Lots to like about this wine, from the Sonoma side of Spring Mountain. Shows firm, fine tannins and well-developed blackberry and cherry flavors. But there's a disturbingly hot, sweet quality, the result of excessive alcohol, and also a sweaty, animal taste that possibly comes from brettanomyces spoilage."
"Very ripe, soft and sugary sweet, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, mocha and caramelized oak. It doesn't really taste like the kind of tannic, ageworthy wine you expect from Diamond Mountain. Drink now."
"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now."
"Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now."
"From Gallo, a two-county blend with some real elegance and style. The Cab is dry, soft and full-bodied, with lingering blackberry, currant, licorice and spice flavors. Drink now."
"A polished, supple Cabernet with real class and style. Drily tannic, it shows a good core of cherries, violets and herbs. Drink soon."
"Bell's basic Cabernet often is a good buy, and the 2005 certainly falls into that category. It shows polished Napa structure, with savory cassis and cedar flavors. Drink now through 2011."
"A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years."
"This is an example of a lighter, drier style of Cabernet that maintains great elegance and charm. It's very dry, showing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors wrapped into firm tannins, and brightened with crispness. Best now–2011."
"Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012."
"Harsh and hot, with chili pepper, mint and thinned-down blackberry and cherry flavors."
"Dry, with thick tannins housing blackberry, herb and olive flavors. Drink now."
"A solid entry into the everyday Cabernet sweepstakes. Shows ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis and spice flavors in a smooth, polished texture whose tannins cry out for steaks and chops."
"Lots of juicy blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors in this dry, full-bodied young wine. But it's also very tannic, with a lockdown astringency. Seems to have the stuffing for more than six years in the cellar."
"This is the best Obsidian Cab since the 2002, and for similar reasons. It was a good vintage for Cabernet. The wine is rich and peppery and lush in black currant flavors, with beautifully sculpted, ripe tannins. Provides more evidence that this Red Hills of Lake County appellation has enormous potential for Cabernet."
"Made from 100% Cab, this wine pours inky black, and feels softly ripe in the mouth, with pie-filling blackberries, cherries, mocha, plums, tobacco and sweet dusty spices. Shows a tannic astringency that strongly suggests cellaring, although it's flashy now. Best after 2011 and beyond."
"Here's one for the cellar. The tannins swamp the mouth, giving a hard, astringent edge. But the wine is beautifully balanced and dry, with a deep core of black currants, blueberries, spicy plums, cedar and minerals. Impressive. Best after 2010."
"At the age of four-plus years, this Cab still tastes young and fresh, as though it were bottled yesterday. Brims with ripe blackberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar, with a nice cut of acidity and ultrarefined tannins. Not quite ready for prime time, so give it 3–5 years to mellow."
"Sweet and simple, with jellied blackberry and cherry flavors, harsh tannins and a sugary finish."
"Dry and softly tannic, this is a nice Cab to drink now with steaks and chops. It has herb-infused flavors of black currants and cherries, with a spicy edge."
"Black currant and cherry flavors, accented with a touch of smoky oak, mark this dry, smooth wine. It has the textural hallmarks of the best of Napa Valley Cabernet, but lacks the richness. Drink now."
"Gentle and candy ripe, this Cab has pie-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, red plums, licorice and chocolate, accented with toasty, spicy oak, wrapped into sweet, fine tannins. Too soft for the cellar, so drink up."
"Showing the rustic tannins and peppery spices that Dry Creek Cabs usually possess, this Cab wants a little time in the cellar. With black currant, chocolate, tobacco and herb flavors, it's very close in quality to the winery's regular '05 Cab, with a little more concentration and a firmer tannin structure."
"With its black pepper aromas and dry, hard tannins that make the mouth pucker, this is an atypical Rutherford Cabernet. But it's a very good, even a noble one. As tough as it is, it possesses a rich core of black currant that lasts through a long finish. Unusual and distinctive, it should hold its own for a decade."
"The 2004 was soft and immediately enjoyable. This '05 is tannic and better structured and needs some time. It displays a wealth of black cherry and currant flavors. Hold if you can until after 2008, and should develop well for an additional 4 years."
"Here's a rich, densely layered Cab. It's showing complex flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and cedar. The tannins are a little edgy, giving the wine an astringent bite that could mellow out with mid-term aging."
"This is a sort of junior bottling to their world-famous and superexpensive Hillside Select. The 2005 is a very good Cab (with 2% Petite Verdot), but a bit on the soft, sweet, obvious side. Showing pie-filling, almost candied cherry, blackberry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, it resembles many other California Cabernets that don't cost nearly as much."
"A very fine example of Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, showing the elegance and complexity wines from that Sonoma County region can attain. Soft and intricate in tannins, the wine shows a mélange of blackberry, currant, cherry, sweet dried herb and smoky flavors that are delicious now, and should hold well for several years."
"Chimney Rock continues a successful string of vintages with this powerful '05. It's a distinguished wine that calls to mind the description of Stags Leap Cabernet as an iron fist in a velvet glove. Rich and full-bodied, it has lush flavors of black currants and smoky new oak. Easy to find, with 28,000 cases produced. Drink now through 2012."
"A delicious Cab, polished and supple, with ripe black and red currant, raspberry, violet, cedar and mocha flavors. Feels soft and velvety in the mouth. Drink now."
"Soft and lush in blackberry-infused chocolate, cherry, licorice and roasted oak flavors, with a hint of red currants, this Cab is, in a word, delicious. It represents how fine Paso Robles Cabernet can be in the right hands."
"Brawny and rustic, this Cab has some sharp edges, but satisfies for ripe blackberry, currant and cedar flavors. Needs rich meats and cheeses to mellow it. Drink now."
"Rustic and simple, with sweetened cherry-berry and cola flavors that finish in a swirl of sugary blackberry jam."
"Outstanding. Ultra-ripe and lush, but very dry, showing powerful, long hangtime flavors of black and red sour cherries, currants, violets and cedar, wrapped into dense, melted tannins. Almost Porty, but stops short of overripeness to finish with dramatic richness. The vineyard is adjacent to Rubicon's, in the heart of the Rutherford bench."
"From a vineyard on Rutherford's cooler, western bench comes this dry, spicy, firmly tannic young 100% Cabernet. It's aggressive and muscular now, with a hard, dusty astringency. But the rich core of red currants, black cherries, mocha, violets and cedar strongly suggests ageability. Better after 2011."
"This winery has had a reputation for making Cabs in a leaner, more ageworthy style, but that is no longer true, to judge by this '05. It's as ripe and fruity as anything out there, and immediately drinkable for its beautiful blackberry, black currant, chocolate and cedar flavors. Still, the tannins are considerable, and the wine should easily negotiate the years. Best now and through 2013, at the least."
"Only the brave and lonely continue to try to forge top Cabernet from Santa Barbara County, especially at this price. While the mission is not impossible, Cabs like this don't advance the cause, no matter how nobly inspired. Dry and herbal, the wine shows only modest blackberry and cherry flavors, and is dry and hard on the finish."
"A lovely Cab, polished and refined, and a huge improvement over the winery's 2004 bottling. Shows classic Napa Valley softness and roundness, a wine that seduces the palate. There are complex flavors of black currants, sweet sage and cedar, wrapped into silky, ripe tannins. Delicious now, and should develop for a decade or more."
"Pretty tannic now, but very well-structured, with a minerally exoskeleton framing dramatic black currant, cassis and cedar flavors. Needs time. 2010–2015."
"Monte Rosso red wines are always big, but this may be the most intense Cabernet ever to come from that mountain vineyard. It's in keeping with the Sbragia style of extreme ripeness and oak. Almost sweet, but really dry, it erupts in black currant, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, and needs time in the cellar to calm down. Best after 2011."
"Soft and gentle in the mouth, with a silky texture, this very ripe Cab shows jammy blackberry, cherry, vanilla and smoke flavors. This is the best Lake county Cab from Guenoc in years."
"A little sharp, but easily the winery's best non-vineyard designated Cab since the '02. Shows a ripeness level that slam dunks cherries, blackberries, cola and oak onto the palate, yet maintains an elegant dryness."
"Shows a return to the form of Souverain's glory days. Beautiful and complex, with luscious flavors of blackberries, currants and dried herbs, wrapped into soft, smooth tannins. Really classy. Best now and through 2012."
"Good for Cinnabar for holding this Cab back a while, to let it develop in the bottle. Although it's still pretty tannic, it has entered its drinkability window. Dry and full-bodied, it shows classic flavors of black currants and smoky cedar, with a long, impressive finish."
"Starting out as a very tannic, closed wine, this is one for the cellar. The question is how long. It's a big, dry, ripe Cab, with extracted blackberry, blueberry and cedar flavors, and while it should soften over the next five years, it doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul."
"The winery's basic Cab, with no vineyard designation, shares the qualities of the more expensive bottlings. It's dry and tannic and ultraconcentrated in varietal character, with explosive cassis, cherry and new oak flavors. Impresses now for its luxurious mouthfeel, and should develop through 2013."
"Super-fruity, with intensely concentrated blackberries, cassis and milk chocolate, while the oak is very heavy in sweet caramel and buttered toast. Not showing much now beyond sheer power. Could develop, but it's risky."
"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008."
"A bit rough and angular, with a jagged tannic structure that suggests not all the grapes were completely ripe. With blackberry, cherry and mint flavors, the wine is at its best now."
"This is a food-friendly Cab. It's made in an elegant style, with fine acidity and firm tannins that frame black and red currant, plum, mocha and cedar flavors. Lovely now, but so balanced, it should develop for ten years."
"Bill Smith is better known for his Pinot Noirs, but he founded La Jota and knows a thing or two about Howell Mountain Cabs. This is a big, dry, tannic mountain wine, virtually undrinkable now for its hard astringency. However, it's a fine cellar candidate. Brims with ripe blackberries and cherries that just need time. Should begin to open in 2008, and develop for another 8 years or so."
"This limited-production wine is a bit tough and awkward now, but may turn the corner in the cellar after 2009. It's softly dry and tannic, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors."
"This is an interesting and different wine. It's much lower in alcohol than most Cabs, but completely dry, with a tobacco and sage pull to the black currant flavors. The firm tannins suggest cellar possibilities."
"Light in body for a Napa Cab but extremely elegant, this polished wine is fully ready to drink now. A blend of Oakville and Calistoga fruit, it's rich in cherry, red and black currant and Dr. Pepper flavors."
"A gorgeous Cabernet, and at this price, a bargain. Shows the greatness of the 2005 vintage, with perfectly ripe red and black cherry fruit, sweetly ripe tannins and a fine edge of acidity. Complex for drinking now, it should continue to develop bottle nuances over the next six years until it slowly winds down."
"A lush, full-bodied Cabernet that, even if a little one-dimensional, shows lots of varietal character. It's soft and a little sweet in vanilla-tinged oak, with jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate."
"The winery does not give us exact new oak statistics, but oak dominates the aroma and flavor of this Cab. Beyond the caramel, smoke and toasty vanilla meringue, the blackberry and currant flavors are a little thin."
"A problematic wine. It's too tannic and closed to enjoy now, and the fruit flavor may not be powerful enough to withstand aging. Then there's the sweaty taste that provides a jarring note, and may be tamping down the fruit."
"A sturdy Cab with some hard, edgy tannins that bite, but with enough black currant and spice flavors to satisfy. Might even soften and mellow with a year or so in the bottle."
"Always pretty, always polished, St. Jean's '05 Cinq Cepages is a solid red wine that drinks well now and should develop with a few years in the cellar. It's dry and firm in tannins, with flavors of blackberries, cassis and new smoky oak, marked by a soft texture of finely ground tannins."
"Made in a lighter, slightly more rustic and less ripe manner, with herb-infused black currant and licorice flavors. A vigorous young 100% Cab elaborated with plenty of new oak. Drink now through 2013."
"A rich, ripe and complex Cabernet, with classic Napa tannic structure. Not quite up there with the winery's higher-priced Dollarhide or Elu bottlings, but showing similar elegance and taste. Brims with blueberry, mocha and cedar flavors that should develop over the next four years."
"Good, but a bit tough and gritty, with a hard edge of tannins. On the other hand there also is dryness and extremely ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, as well as sweet oak. Not showing well now, but could benefit from some years in the cellar."
"Soft and easy, with very ripe blackberry and currant flavors that veer into chocolate-covered raisins. Finishes a bit hot, but dry."
"Firmly tannic and dry, this Cabernet, which was blended with a little Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, is one for the cellar. The tannins are tough and astringent, but when they melt away over the next decade or so, they'll leave behind sweet currants, cedar and violets."
"You'll want to stash this young Cab away for a while because it's too closed and tannic now for enjoyment. But it has a very rich, concentrated core of cassis flavor and is dry and balanced in acidity. Should negotiate the next 6–8 years easily, and maybe longer."
"This is a pretty good wine, dry, spicy and full-bodied, but it's not particularly Cabernet-ish or Napa-ish. It could be Zinfandel or Syrah or anything, with its peppery black currant and mocha flavors. It's also quite soft. Drink now."
"The cassis, black currant, chocolate and sweet oak flavors star in this soft, easy wine. It could use a firmer structure, but it's very savory and easy to drink."
"A nice glass of Cab for $13. It's bone dry, with a scour of sandpapery tannins, and hints of cherries, blackberries, plums, cola and cedar. Shows real class for a statewide-appellated Cab at this price."
"Very young now and a bit rude, with upfront primary fruit flavors of cherries, black raspberries and new oak. Needs time for all the parts to knit together. Cellar through 2009, at least, and should hold for a while afterward."
"The wine is fantastic, albeit tannic. It's not a gushy one to open tonight. The tannins have a dry astringency, but even so, you can taste fabulously ripe blackberries, black cherries and currants. This wine should begin to come into its own next year and hold for many years."
"Sharp and grapey, with sweet, jellied flavors of cherries, blackberries and chocolate. With a production of nearly a half-million cases, lots and lots of folks will happily wash down their meats and pasta with this easy red wine."
"Tasted in September ‘07, this Cab was pretty high in tannins, giving it a tough astringency some folks won't like. But the wine is clean and complex, with blackberry, tobacco and sage flavors. It's the opposite of a cult Cabernet, which is to say it's more like a traditional dry Bordeaux than something out of Napa."
"Dazzles now for its richness. Shows those classic Howell Mountain tannins, but they've been so tamed and refined, you can drink it now. The flavors are spectacular, over the top; pure Cirque du Soleil spectacle of blackberry, currant and chocolate acrobatics."
"Moon Mountain dropped the price on their basic Cab years ago, and with it, quality dipped. The concentration just isn't here. On the other hand, it's a nice, smooth, clean wine, with enough blackberry and currant varietal character to satisfy Cab lovers."
"Rich and succulent, this mountain-grown Cabernet offers concentrated black currant, cherry, red licorice, date-nut cake, vanilla and smoke flavors that are wrapped into firm, complex but gentle tannins. It's lovely now, with the focused balanced to age for several years."
"A bit earthy. One hundred percent new oak dominates the jammy black cherry, violet and herb flavors. Feels somewhat tired, even though it's only three-plus years old."
"Soft and oaky, this Cab has a slightly rustic mouthfeel. It's very ripe in cherries, blackberries and smoky vanilla. Drink now."
"Rustic and country-style, this Cab has juicy berry flavors wrapped into rough, green tannins. Turns sugary sweet on the finish."
"Made in the modern cult style, this 100% varietal Cabernet is soft and lush. While it's technically dry, it tastes sweet, the result of ripe fruit, high alcohol and lots of charry new oak. Shows oodles of chocolate, black currant and plum flavors that end in a swirl of Asian spices. Now through 2012."
"This is a good, rich, complex Cab, but it's also toughly tannic, and needs time in the cellar to come around. Beneath the astringency are ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries and sweet fresh herbs. Give it until 2011, if you can."
"A good Cab, dry and smoothly tannic, with black currant, cedar and spice flavors. Totally dry, it shows sophistication and class, but not ageability. Easy to find, with more than 15,000 cases produced. Drink now."
"This bottling can be variable, but the '05 vintage helped craft a balanced, likeable Cab that shows true Napa quality at an everyday price. Dry and richly tannic, the wine shows herb-infused black currant, black tea and cedar flavors. Drink now through 2011."
"With oak-inspired blackberry, cherry, currant, anise and spice flavors that taste a bit jammy and direct now, this wine could benefit from a few years in the cellar. That could let all the parts meld together."
"This is the kind of Cabernet that's soft and accessible enough to drink now. It's rich in blackberry, cherry and spice flavors, with a sweet edge of charred wood. Saved from mere simplicity by a fine, firm tannic structure."
"Ripe and jammy, this Cab comes from a vineyard east of St. Helena on the lower slopes of Howell Mountain. The wine is extremely ripe and jammy, with pronounced blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and currant flavors. A little aggressive in fruity sharpness now, it should calm down over the next several years."
"Where Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search."
"Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent. This is one for the cellar and will age for at least a decade and probably far longer. Try to keep your hands off it until after 2011."
"A little sharp and edgy, with some bitterness in the finish, but this is mostly an enjoyable Cab. It's dry and rich in tannins, with currant, licorice and smoky oak flavors."
"One of the riper of the Highland Estate's current crop of Cabernets, the Hawkeye Mountain shows intense varietal character. It's rich in black currants and cedar, with a tangy minerality and firm but pliant tannins. A beautiful Cabernet, at its best now and through 2015."
"This dry, spicy wine shows the rustic, rugged quality that often accompanies Dry Creek Cabs. It has the briary texture of a Zinfandel, but with Cabernet's classic blackberry and black currant profile. Drink now–2012."
"This wine has the solid tannins the mountain is known for, and ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, cherries and chocolate, enriched with new oak. At twenty bucks, and with a low production, it's a stunning value. With real elegance and even ageworthiness, it's one of the best at its price point available now."
"Soft and ripe in extracted cherry and blackberry jam fruit, this also has some heat on the palate, the result of 15% alcohol. It feels a little simple, and the heat is off-putting."
"Pretty run of the mill, a tannic Cab with flavors of herbs and berries. Fulfills the basic requirements of dryness and full-bodied balance. Drink now."
"Pretty tannic, with an astringent hardness. But the flavors are so rich and powerful, they break through, offering a wealth of ripe blackberries, black cherries, mocha, sweet smoky cedar wood and Asian spices. Nice now with a grilled steak, or stash for up to six years in the cellar."
"A rich, polished Cabernet. Doesn't taste particularly Oakville-like, due to extreme ripeness, softness, high alcohol and refined tannins that could come from anywhere, but it's well crafted and delicious. Offers waves of blackberries, black currants, chocolate and cedar. Now–2013."
"A little rough in texture and stemmy, with a sugary sweet finish, but with enough cherry, blackberry and currant flavors to satisfy everyday red wine drinkers."
"Rich and flavorful, this Cabernet has jammy flavors of cassis, cherries, milk chocolate, licorice and vanilla. The wine is almost sweet and very soft in structure, the kind of Cab that adheres to today's cult parameters. Drink now through 2010."
"More like the 2000 than the richer '97 or '99, J. Lohr's 2005 Hilltop Cab is very fruity, but a little too soft. The cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spicy plum flavors have a melted quality. Drink soon."
"Very rich and extracted, with massive flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that taste like they were baked into a pastry, and sprinkled with cocoa, anise, vanilla and a touch of salt and black pepper. Delicious and forward, and should hold steady over the next six years."
"Pretty straightforward Cabernet, done well and blended with bits of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Vanilla, tobacco and cassis aromas mark the nose, while the flavors are similar, but with a slightly plummy edge. Soft and supple on the finish, there's no need to cellar this wine."
"Somewhat sharp in acids and tannins, with a streak of green mint that weakens the blackberry and cherry flavors. Good structure, but a bit unripe and unbalanced, and not likely to age."
"Ironstone's reserve Cab is getting better and better, the result of attention to detail. The 2005, held back for three years before release, remains a toughly tannic wine, but it's dry, balanced and elegant and contains a rich core of berry-currant fruit. Should develop for the next six years."
"Lots of new, smoky oak stands out on this polished Cab. Give it a little time in a decanter before you drink, as it pulls together, becoming more powerful and accenting the blackberry and cherry flavors. Should develop for a decade."
"Complex and rich, with a wealth of black currant, blackberry and cedar flavors wrapped into softly firm tannins. There's an herbal quality that makes the wine suited to stews and casseroles. Drink now through 2011."
"This is a strong-tasting Cabernet that lacks subtlety. But if you're looking for a kick of black currants and lots of tingly acidity, you might enjoy it."
"Rather overripe, this Cab has the flavors of stewed or baked blackberries and raisins. On the plus side are rich chocolate and anise notes, smooth, firm tannins and a dry, spicy finish."
"A good, sound wine, but far from a success for the Artist Series. In fact it shows rustic tannins and the slightly sweet softness you might find in, say, a Paso Robles Cab. Disappointing."
"A very good wine, although a very young one that needs time. It's not because the tannins are hard, because they're not. But the primary blackberry and cherry flavors haven't married with the oak, despite the wine being more than three years of age. The grapes come from a tenderloin of the appellation that's known for quality. Best after 2009."
"This is a very dry, richly textured Cabernet, vast in blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, with the smooth, complex tannins Oakville is known for. However, there's a noticeable sharpness to the mouthfeel that may never go away."
"Except for some excessive sharpness in the finish, this is a lush, opulent young Cab. It shows ripe cassis, chocolate and oak flavors wrapped into firm, sweet tannins. That sharpness may limit ageability."
"A fine Cabernet that defines Alexander Valley's benchlands. It's entirely dry, a subtle wine whose herb-tinged blackberries, cherries and cedar turn increasingly complex in the glass. Shows a lightness and airy feeling that differentiates it from the heavier cult Napa style. Already throwing some sediment, so you might want to decant it before serving."
"Very ripe in cassis, with plenty of smoky oak influence and a spicy, dry finish. This is a bold, tannic young wine, tight and astringent in youth. It needs time in the cellar to soften and meld. Should be best between 2009 and 2011, and live far longer."
"Dry and toughly tannic, with currant and oak flavors that have an edge of overripe raisins and prunes. Drink now."
"They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power. This serious new Napa Cab is great now, and should develop for many years."
"The vineyard is in the heart of the Rutherford bench. The wine is rich in fruit and tannins, but a bit clumsy, with a chunky, tannic mouthfeel and jammy, direct blackberry and blueberry fruit flavors. Not ready for drinking now, but well-made, and should age well, as Cabs from this stretch tend to have a long life."
"Oakville specialist Far Niente turns to Rutherford for this single-vineyard, 100% Cab. The wine is soft and exceptionally ripe in blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, while lots of toasty oak adds vanilla accents that make the wine jammy. Doesn't have the structural complexity of the Oakville bottlings, but sure is tasty."
"Here's a big, lush Cab, appealing now for its jammy blackberry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. But the tannins make for an unsettled astringency that needs rich meats to cut through. Fine now with complex beef dishes, but better after 2010."
"Plenty of flavor in this extremely ripe wine. Bursting with blackberry and cherry pie filling, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors, it's clearly delicious. Yet it's a very soft wine. Makes you wish it were firmer in structure, to support all that decadent flavor. Made entirely from the Stagecoach Vineyard, and the alcohol is 15.5%."
"The sugary sweetness of this wine exaggerates the tannins, making them taste more raw and angular than they really are. Flavor-wise, it's all about cherry and blackberry jam."
"A blend of grapes from St. Helena and Coombsville, this is a balanced combination of warm, ripe fruit and cool-climate acidity. The flavors are ripe with black currants and new French oak. It's already throwing sediment, but it should reward additional time in the cellar. Give it until at least 2017, although it could still be rocking and rolling in 2025."
"Young and bony, with primary fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries, briary tobacco and cedar. With its dry finish and rich tannins, it's a candidate for limited cellaring. Best late 2009 through 2010."
"Simple and fruity, with upfront blackberry jam, cherry, currant and cocoa flavors, wrapped into fine, smooth tannins. Tasty, but lacks definition and complexity."
"Fruity and simple, with pie-filling blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors that have been generously oaked. Almost sweet, a fruit bomb. Doesn't seem likely to age."
"With very ripe fruit and firm tannins, this mountain Cab shows attractive flavors of cassis and cedar. It's pretty tough and astringent in youth, so decant it and drink with rich marbled beef."
"This inaugural release is pretty good, made in the international or cult style of softness, extreme ripeness and early palate appeal. It's forward in jammy cherry, black currant and plum flavors."
"A great wine that combines the modern, ultraripe winemaking style with Rutherford's fine, complex tannins and herbs. Feels plush and velvety in the mouth, exploding in blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors grounded with sweet sage. An ager. Beautiful now through 2012, at least."
"Mount Eden makes their estate Cab the old-fashioned way: to age. The '05 is quite tannic and shut down right now, with a hard astringency, especially on the finish. However, it's rich in black currants, mocha and cedar, and is a natural for many years in the cellar. The score could rise considerably after 2011."
"This bone-dry wine is rather severe in tannins. It feels elegant, but lacks immediate reward, with cherry, currant and tobacco flavors that disappear into a cloak of astringency. Could develop after 2011, but no guarantees."
"This particular bottling is a work in progress by veteran Brutocao. It's a step forward in their attempt to master Cabernet. The wine still has a rustic edge, with blackberry jam flavors wrapped into firm tannins, and a sweet finish."
"At nearly eight years of age, this Napa-based Cabernet has just been released by Gershon Bachus, which is based in Temecula. It's a beautiful wine, poised at that delicate balance where the fresh fruit is starting to turn the corner. Already throwing some sediment, it's just at the beginning of a long journey. Drink now–2020."
"Sweet and candied, like a dessert pastry, with sugary flavors of currants, chocolate and anise. The structure is fine. Will appeal to red wine drinkers with a sweet tooth."
"Good, rich Napa Cabernet in this bottle, packed with blackberry, currant, licorice and cedar flavors. The wine shows a firm, full-bodied texture. Best now and through 2010."
"Very fruit-driven, this dry Cab has jammy cherry, blackberry and currant flavors, with a rich edge of cedar and cocoa. It's a bit immature now and should develop bottle complexities over the next 6–8 years."
"Six Sigma's Cabernet is entirely unproven, but this one shows great promise. With a heavy rusticity, it has a way to go, but the blackberry and currant fruit is so rich, the tannin-acid balance so fine, that it's just a matter of time before this estate lands on the coveted map."
"The fruit is plenty ripe, offering rich flavors of blackberries and black currants, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The drawback with this Cab is its texture. It's rough and angular, suggesting unevenly ripe stems and seeds. Drink now."
"This single-vineyard Cabernet is softening and mellowing, with flavors of cherry, mocha and oak that are picking up sweet, mushroomy, gamy notes. Carmel Valley is a small appellation in a warm part of inland Monterey County that specializes in Bordeaux red wines. It's drinking well now."
"Inky dark and tannic now, this 100% Cabernet, aged in 50% new French oak barrels, seems aimed for the cellar. It's tough as nails now, but has an enormous heart of cassis. Give this low-production wine a good 4–6 years of aging."
"Made in the modern Napa style, this Cab shows very ripe fruit, soft acids, buttery tannins and quite a bit of smoky new oak. The combination tastes like a blackberry and cherry pastry, with the sweet crust, but the finish is dry. Should do interesting things over the next six to eight years."
"There's a pure, sweet Cabernet in the bottle that wants to come out, but it's held back right now with sturdy tannins that make for a palate astringency. The flavors are explosive, of blackberries, cassis, cherries, chocolate and smoky new oak. Needs time. Best after 2011 and well beyond."
"Frank Family is one of those wineries that Cab lovers should know more about. This, their basic Napa Cab, is a solid hit, tannic, dry and balanced. It shows classic flavors of black currants, with contributing notes of chocolate, anise and cedar."
"A bit herbal, green and sharp, this Cab has modest flavors of blackberries and cherries, enriched with some new French oak."
"A very nice Cabernet that's superdrinkable because of its soft, appealing fruit, but also has plenty of complexity. Cherries, blackberries, blueberries and dark chocolate are enriched with spicy oak notes, leading to a long, balanced finish."
"This is really a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft and polished, it shows herb and cassis flavors, wrapped in rich smoky oak, with a long, dry finish. The tannins are quite strong now, giving the wine a chewy toughness and suggesting moderate aging. Hold until after 2008."
"The director has turned his eye to Sonoma County to produce less expensive wines.  It's a little too ripe, with blackberry, raisin and prune flavors and some edgy tannins."
"Ripe and rather harsh, this Cab has simple flavors of blackberries, currants, plums, mocha and woodspice. The finish is peppery and hot."
"A beautiful Cabernet, made in an elegantly approachable way. Dry and smooth, it shows complex flavors of blackberries, currants and dried herbs, wrapped into rich, dusty tannins. The alcohol level is quite high, but balanced, in a California way."
"Very ripe and fruity in the modern style, almost too strong in blackberry jam, black currant and oak flavors that are not particularly subtle or delicate, although the wine is thoroughly dry. The tannins are significant, but negotiable. The suggestion is ageability. Give it 2–4 years and try again."
"A very nice Cab, a little dry and brittle by itself, but with a rich core of black currants, cherries and herbs framed in rich tannins. All it needs is a good steak to make it sing."
"A very good Cabernet, although a young one. It's classically structured, with fine tannins and acidity framing ripe, luxurious flavors of blackberries, black currants and cocoa, accentuated by smoky oak. Good now, with decanting, but should be better by late 2010."
"A beautiful wine that has the character of a modern, ripe, cult-style wine, but maintains balance and elegance. The black currant and cedar flavors are enormously satisfying, while the wine is entirely dry."
"Vibrant, fruity and dry now, with savory black currant, red currant, plum and cherry flavors, this Cab also has a spicy, minty quality that makes it come alive on the palate. It's young and tannic, and will benefit from up to eight years in the cellar."
"Mondavi Cabernet from Paso Robles? Well, yes, and a pretty good one for the price. It's dry and balanced, with juicy currant, blackberry and oak flavors. Shows quite a bit of sophistication. Drink now."
"Here's a Cabernet producer to keep your eyes on. The winemaker is Kian Tavakoli, who earned his stripes at Opus One and Clos du Val. The wine is sourced from three top vineyards, including To Kalon. It's a very ambitious effort, one that defines great Napa Cab. Softly tannic now in its youth, the blackberry, currant and smoky oak flavors are delicious and complex, offering waves of ever-changing nuances. Should develop well for several years."
"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine is very soft and somewhat sweet in pie-filling blackberry, cherry, chocolate and spice flavors. Drink now."
"Showing a good structure of tannins and acids and ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate and cola, this Cab finishes too sweet. It has a sugary taste, like a health food power bar."
"Very soft and direct in plummy black currant flavors that are so ripe, they veer into plumped raisins and prunes. The wine is fully dry, with refined tannins. Drink now."
"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around. Give it three or four years for the black currants to marry with the cedar and become smoky-sweet."
"Tannins are the star here, the tough, young, chewy mountain kind that straitjacket the wine in its youth. But experience shows that cellaring rewards. When the tannins fall out, the sweet, juicy blackberry and cherry flavors can do their thing. This beautiful Bordeaux-style Cab will be best between 2009–2013."
"A very good Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend from Agustin Huneeus. While it would not be true to say it's a second wine of Quintessa, it does show the balance and integrity of that bottling, with a firm structure and dramatically layered black currant, mineral and cedar flavors. Will undoubtedly age. Best now through 2011, at least."
"Bursting at the seams with ripe, juicy flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and anise, this Cab has a rich overlay of smoky oak. It's a little on the soft, heavy side. Drink soon."
"A rustic, brawny wine made for barbecued steak, this Cab has pronounced tannins balanced by lots of sweet, ripe fruit. The cherry, blackberry, plum and unsweetened chocolate flavors have a spicy, peppery finish."
"Shows the classic structure of Oakville, with impeccably ripe tannins, and the winemaker's touch of oak is deft. The black currant flavors could use a bit more concentration, though, as there's a stubborn thinness throughout."
"Shows the soft acids, gentle tannins and herbaceousness that mark most Alexander Valley Cabs, with supporting cherry, red currant and licorice flavors. It's a complex wine, balanced and intriguing, and a fine pairing for a very wide variety of foods. Interestingly, indigenous, or wild, yeast was used for fermentation."
"With their '05 reserve, Reverie has produced possibly their greatest Cabernet Sauvignon ever. But be forewarned, it needs cellaring. Not a long time, just enough to soften and sweeten a bit. Right now, the tannins shove to the front of the line, pushing aside the delicious blackberries and currants. But the wine has Bordeaux-like elegance. Even a few years in the bottle will help resolve things."
"Clearly well-origined, to judge from the fine structure and essential purity. But it's a very tannic, closed wine, with a mouth-numbing astringency that accentuates the acidity. Even so, it's so ripe in blackberries and currants it's almost drinkable now, with a good decant. But you're best off cellaring a good 4–6 years."
"A bit too soft, which makes the exceptionally ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors stand alone and lack structure. Tasty and flashy, but the palate longs for more acids and tannins."
"Tough in tannins, with a minty, green streak to the cherries and blackberries. Tasty but hard now. Could develop with some time in the bottle. Try after 2010."
"Like Martin Ray's other '05 reserve Cabs, the Stags Leap bottling is rich, soft and immediately appealing for its luscious array of flavors. What's not to like about blackberries, cherries, raspberries, chocolate, cedar and smoky vanilla? The tannins are very fine, giving the wine a silky, velvety mouthfeel."
"This comes from Bacio Divino, which has been crafting wines under that label for some years. The consulting winemaker was the veteran Nils Venge. The wine is dry, full-bodied and very ripe, showing classic Napa cassis flavors wrapped into superfine tannins. As good as it is, one wonders what sets it apart from all the rest."
"Rattlesnake Hill is on the estate, more than 2,000 feet up in the Mayacamas above St. Helena. Typically tannic, in the way of Spring Mountain Cabs, the '05 is a dramatically structured wine that dazzles with power. Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows classic varietal flavors of black currants, cherries, licorice and spices, while mostly new French oak adds the perfect facade of smoky wood. Fabulous now with decanting and over rich fare such as steak, the wine should age gracefully for at least a decade."
"Howell Mountain has been the source of Piña's best Cabs, and this single-vineyard bottling shows stunning concentration and complexity. It's closed and tannic now, in the manner of Howell Mountain Cabs, but enormous in ripe black currant fruit, with the power and focus to age for many years. Best after 2009 and through 2017, but only with impeccable cellar conditions."
"This vineyard has never produced anything less than great Cabernet, and Surh Luchtel, who buys grapes from it, has a great track record. As always, the '05 is stunningly rich and refined. It shows powerful flavors of cassis and minerals, which come from the grapes, and the most tasteful overlay of toasty oak. Fine now, and should hold for a decade."
"Rich, thick and jammy sweet, this Cab tasted a bit juvenile in the winter of 2009. With blackberry and cherry pie filling, chocolate, licorice and pepper flavors, it might develop harmony over the next six years."
"Deliciously drinkable now, with very dry but ripely opulent flavors of black currants, cherry marmalade, mocha, root beer and caramelized oak. Could have greater structure and a longer finish, but lovely with a charbroiled steak."
"This Cab is a bit sweet in raisin and currant fruit and astringent in dry, hard tannins. Together, they give a rustic feeling. Not going anywhere, so drink now."
"This basic Cab shows blackberry, currant and oak flavors wrapped into firm tannins. It's a sound, good wine, with a briary, rustic edge. Drink now."
"Ultra-ripe, this Cab is decadently tasty, but not really dry. It's almost as gooey soft and sweet as a dessert pastry, with flavors of pie crust, chocolate pudding, sweet blackberry jam, currants and licorice. Drink now."
"Aloof now, this Cab holds you at a distance with its provocative tannins. But it's a very fine wine that shows real Napa pedigree. Balanced and harmonious, it features complex flavors of blackberries, cassis and cedar wood that turn sweet on the finish. Should be at its best between 2010 and 2013 and then slowly fade away."
"Difficult to find much to like here. Smells baked and Porty, and tastes overtly sweet in residual sugar, like cherry and raspberry jam."
"Soft and dull, with vegetal and blackberry flavors that finish sweet and cloying."
"A little on the sweet side, but for the equivalent of $5 a bottle, this 3 liter Cab in a box provides good varietal character. The blackberry and cherry flavors are wrapped into sturdy tannins."
"Direct in fruit, simple in structure, this Cab shows ripe blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla and spice flavors. Best enjoyed with easy fare like hamburgers and such."
"At nearly seven years in age, this 100% Cabernet is still offering ripe, fresh blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors. It feels young, with firm, hard tannins, but very fine and complex. Just at the beginning of its journey, it will easily reward further cellaring. Hold until 2015, at the very least."
"Pie-filling blackberries, cherries and currants star in this heavy, soft, oaky Cabernet. It's fully dry, and the tannins are rich and fine, but it lacks a bit of liveliness. Drink now."
"Frankly delicious, a wine with the most decadent profile. Just erupts with only-in-California black currant, cassis, black cherry, chocolate, red plum jam and smoky cedar flavors that testify to the finest viticulture. For all that, the wine is quite soft and sweet. Give it greater structure, and the score would soar."
"The grapes for this Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blend were grown in the Chiles Valley section of Napa. The wine in its youth is extremely tannic and dry, making it unsuitable for drinking anytime soon. But it's exceptionally balanced and has a deep, attractive core of black currant and cedar flavors. There's no reason why it should not age well. Try after 2011."
"Very dry and fairly tannic, with cassis flavors, this Cab is quite enjoyable now and should hold for a couple of years. It has an elegance and structural balance that bring to mind the pre-cult era of Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon."
"A rich, satisfying Cabernet, packed with blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, with a touch of herbs and mint. Not quite as dense or concentrated as the winery's mountain-appellated Cabs, but quite a good one."
"Way too oaky. Like drinking toothpicks, with its charred, wood flavors and oak tannins. The wine is dry and the underlying blackberry and cherry sour candy fruit is just fine, but the oak dominance makes you wonder if the wine will ever age."
"The oak is strong, giving a toasty, charcoal aroma and tannic texture, and the acids and grape tannins likewise contribute to making this wine rather aloof. Underneath are good, complex cherry and raspberry flavors, with an earthy richness approaching chocolate. Seems to have all the parts in place to age. Try around 2012."
"The estate vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, east of the city of Napa. You can taste the cool climate in the brisk acidity that frames this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's very ripe in blackberries, with rich layers of toast from new French oak. For all the sweet fruit, the finish is dry, even rasping. Such are the tannins that the wine feels tough, even at this age. Give it another five years, at least."
"You can think of this as a second label of Lancaster, the Cab producer whose estate vineyard the grapes come from. It's a pretty good Cab, strongly flavored and dry, with brisk tannins and a streak of herbs. The currant flavors taste a little overripe and raisiny."
"Fruit and spice star in this bone-dry Cabernet. It's very forward in blackberries, cherries, currants and dark chocolate, while the spice shows in the form of pepper, clove and star anise. The tannins are quite strong and rasping, and may never fully resolve. Give it 3–5 years in the cellar."
"Still strong and jammy at the age of four-plus, with fresh blackberry, black currant and spicy oak flavors brightened with zingy acidity. It's a distinctly New World wine, and a very good one, but it needs a year or three in the cellar to mellow and resolve."
"This is a densely structured young Cab. Although the tannins are  ripe and sweet, they still possess enough astringency to suggest cellaring. This wine is terrifically rich in black currants and exotic, smoky oak—a big, rich Cab whose impeccable structure defines Oakville. Unfined and unfiltered, it will be best after 2008 and through 2017."
"Cabernet collectors who look beyond Napa Valley should be aware of this wine. It's an important addition to the Alexander Valley pantheon, a densely layered young wine. Shows brilliant red stone fruit, cassis, cola, date nut bread, mocha and tangerine zest flavors gorgeously lavished with the vanilla and smoky caramel of oak. Just delicious now, and should slowly spread its wings for many years."
"Made in the modern cult style, this Cab is soft, voluptuously oaky and extracted in perfectly ripe blackberries and currants, with spicy, oaky notes. It's refined and classically Napa and impressive, although it's not that much different from other Cabs of its pedigree."
"An elegant Cabernet, with firm tannins framing classic flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, cedar and spice. Notable for its balance and plush mouthfeel. Best now through 2011."
"Bone dry, this wine shows the soft, dusty tannins and herbal flavors that classically mark Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. It has an elegant structure housing flavors of blackberries, currants, sage, tobacco and cedar, and should develop in the bottle over the next 6–8 years."
"Few wines out of Napa Valley need age as much as this one does. That's due to its mountain origins and the cool vintage, which combine to make the tannins pushy and hard. But once they start to fall out, the blackberry and currant flavors should emerge, pure and sweet. Best after 2010, but if you open it before that, decant."
"Here's a good, everyday Cab if you're looking for a bargain. It's dry, tannic and earthy, with suggestions of currants and oak."
"All the parts haven't come close to knitting together in this Cab. The smoky new oak is out there on its own, while the ripe black currants and savory cherries are doing their own thing. It's unintegrated. But judging from the quality of the tannins, it should develop in the cellar. Try after 2010."
"This is a very rich, and perhaps ageable, Cabernet Sauvignon, made with one-fifth Cabernet Franc. Grown from Calistoga grapes, it's soft enough to drink now, with chocolaty flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and mint. Lots of new oak adds caramel and smoky vanilla, but the wine is powerful enough to handle them. Give it through 2010 to integrate."
"Scores high on the deliciousness factor, a softly gentle, rich wine with flavors of blackberry jam, cassis, cedar and fine, dried herbs. The winery is trying very hard to boost the quality of their Reserve Cab. The challenge is to build in those extra layers of complexity and depth."
"A bit heavy and rugged, with dry black currant and unsweetened chocolate flavors that veer into raisins. Not likely to improve, so drink now."
"This is a very dry Cab whose blackberry flavors have nuances of green olives and smoky oak. Notable for its balance, it's a nice, inexpensive red wine to have with fancy meals."
"Made from Beckstoffer's portion of To Kalon, this is exceptionally rich and decadent. Cabs don't get much riper. Blasts off with black currants, cassis, chocolate fudge and exotic spices. But the wine is soft and the alcohol is quite high, making it almost sweet. Would benefit from being drier and more structured."
"Drier and better structured than your typical Paso Robles Cab, this polished wine shows an earthy, herbal edge to the cherry, blackberry and cedar flavors. Shows a Bordeaux-like finesse and elegance that's all too rare in Cabernet from this appellation."
"A lovely young Cab, rich and balanced, and with the elegance you expect from this producer. Made from all 5 Bordeaux varieties, with a drop of Syrah, the wine is potent in red and black currant, blackberry and new oak flavors, with sweetly ripe tannins. Delicious now, it should develop through 2015."
"Shows classic Howell Mountain tight, hard tannins that lock down the flavors and make the wine astringent. But what flavors they are. Just detonates on the palate with massive blackberries, currants, plums, chocolate and cedar, with incredible depth and length. Desperately needs time. Best after 2011."
"This is a dark, big, deeply flavored Cabernet whose tannic structure strongly suggests mid- to long-term aging. Bone dry, it has flashy flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and cedar. Very fine. Best 2010–2015, if not longer in a proper cellar."
"A gorgeous Cab, lush and soft and delicious. Shows a New World, cult winemaking sensibility, with superripe fruit and melted tannins framing blackberry and cherry pie, cassis, dark chocolate, anise and cedar flavors. Should age for the next ten years."
"Here's an elegant, full-bodied Cabernet packed with power and grace. It feels lush and classy in the mouth, a dry, softly tannic wine with rich flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Drinks well now and should age well for 6–8 more years."
"Very soft and melted, this Cabernet has ripe flavors of blackberries and plums that veer into currants and raisins. Drink now."
"Soft and melted, this Cab has pastry-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. It's a bit on the sweet side, and could use greater tannin and acid structure."
"This very tannic wine is fierce and astringent at this time. It's almost old-fashioned in its puckery dryness. True, it has a deep core of ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and cola flavors that could emerge after sufficient aging, but it's not a certainty."
"Raw and harsh, with green, unripe tannins framing simple berry jam flavors."
"Erickson is the winemaker at Screaming Eagle, and he participated in this charitable project for Lookout Ridge. A blend of the two Cabernets, it's soft, unctuous and decadent, in the modern cult Napa style. Floods the mouth with pastry-filling blackberries, cherries, currants, cassis, chocolate and bacon. Drink now through 2010 for freshness."
"Impresses for its depth, power and balance, a wine whose classic acid-tannin structure could only have come from a pedigreed terroir. There's an enormous concentration of black currants and minerals, but the wine is immature in astringent tannins. Needs time, and possibly lots of it. Best 2011 and beyond."
"This is the densest, most tannic of Pride's new releases, obviously meant for the cellar. You could drink it now, because it's so lush, but the tightness suggests that the winemaker doesn't want you to. Buried under the astringency are masses of cassis, dark chocolate, sweet fresh herbs and smoky oak. Better after 2010."
"From one of the oldest vineyards on Diamond Mountain, this Bordeaux blend is impressively powerful and balanced. Based on Cabernet, with small quantities of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, it has oak-influenced black and red currant, cassis, cherry, spicy plum pudding and sweet, smoky vanilla flavors, with a cedar, pencil-lead note reminiscent of a fine Pauillac. Lush now, it should develop well through 2015."
"Pretty good for the price, a balanced, smooth Cab with polished blackberry, cherry, plum, cedar and rosemary flavors. Good value in a dry red table wine."
"A decent everyday Cab, a little rough around the edges, but dry, flavorful and firm in tannins. Nice and moderate in alcohol, it's ready to drink now."
"A strongly flavored, tannic wine, marked by black currant, blackberry and blueberry flavors, sprinkled with exotic Indian spices. Drink this bone-dry Cabernet over the next several years."
"Comes down on the rustic side, but for the price it's pretty good for a dry Cabernet. Shows the variety's full-bodied fanciness in the blackberry, currant, cocoa and licorice flavors, with a rich steak of vanilla oak."
"There's something so smoothly sweet about this Cabernet, it's like an old Cognac. The sweetly toasted oak is merging its caramel and vanilla with the ripe black and red cherries, leading to an unctuous, long, spicy finish. Really quite a compelling wine that's beautiful now."
"This is a lovely Cabernet Sauvignon that's drinking well now, although it's certainly tannic. It should hold well through the next 6 years. Dry and balanced, it shows classic flavors of blackberries and black currants, with earthier notes of olive tapenade and carob."
"It's all about sweet, delicious flavor in this 100% Cabernet. Dazzles the mouth with the essence of blackberries, cassis, cherry tart with the smoky crust, chocolate and exotic sandalwood, wrapped into the richest, finest tannins you can imagine. Compulsively drinkable, if a little too forward with its charms. Now–2013."
"A little rustic and sharp, but perfectly okay if you're looking for an everyday Cab to elevate simple fare. It shows black currant and oak flavors, and is thoroughly dry."
"Smells and tastes like inexpensive Port, with caramelized wood, baked cherry and sugared black currant jam notes."
"Not showing much succulence right now, but firm and sturdy, in keeping with the relatively cool vintage. There's green, minty taste alongside the berry, cherry and anise flavors. Could develop and soften with a year or so in the bottle."
"Extraordinarily ripe, this Cab erupts with pie-filling blackberry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. It's not exactly sweet, but seems so, especially with the caramelized oak coating. Drink now with a grilled steak."
"Soft and fleshy, this Cab has forward flavors of berries, chocolate, cedar and spices, with a touch of sweaty leather. Polished and easy to drink now."
"Here's a complex, layered wine that impresses for sheer power. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of black currants, blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate, anise and cedar that finish deep and long. Delicious and dry, but quite closed now in tannins, and needs time. Best after 2009, at least."
"Quite a good young Cab, deeply flavored in red and black currants, plums, chocolate and oak. Has a weight, density and balance that feel important and authoritative. Not an ager, but epitomizes a delicious Napa Cab to drink now."
"A bit hot and indelicate, but very ripe, with currant jam and blackberry pie-filling flavors richly layered with smoky, caramelized oak. Finishes with warm-climate sweetness. From the warm, eastern part of Santa Ynez Valley known as Happy Canyon."
"Von Strasser has a good track record with this wine, and the '05 is right up there with the best, but be forewarned. It's very tannic. But then, it is from Diamond Mountain. Give it a good 4 years, at least, to throw some sediment and let the rich blackberry and black currant flavors emerge. Should hold well for 15 years."
"Very hard in tannins, with a real lockdown astringency in the mouth, this is one for the cellar, and it's a slam dunk that age will reward it. Drily balanced and elegantly constructed, it brims with rich blackberry and black currant flavors, with a fine coating of spicy oak. Best 2012–2018."
"Merryvale's '05 is very rich and balanced, and shows fine Napa Cabernet character in the intense focus of cassis, enriched with new French oak. It's not an ager, but showcases very high Napa quality for immediate drinking."
"Not ready for drinking now. Shows youthfully aggressive tannins and forward flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and unintegrated new oak, making it the least satisfactory of Stonestreet's impressive new releases if you're looking for something now. Seems like it will make a very fine bottle after 2011 or so."
"A little rough around the edges, with some green tannins and minty, herbal flavors. You get some candied cherries and currants, but the wine is pretty rustic."
"Cass has been focusing on Bordeaux reds in Paso Robles; their Cab Franc has been very good, and this Cabernet Sauvignon is better. It shows its warm origins in very ripe fruit flavors of blackberries, currants and chocolate, but the structure is enlivened with fine acidity and rich, dusty tannins. Delicious and dry, it shows an elegance that makes it irresistible."
"Made in the modern style, this Cab is soft and creamy in the mouth, and fantastically rich. It oozes ripe, crushed blackberries, black currants and dark unsweetened chocolate, with the sweetness coming from natural fruit and caramelized oak. The tannins are as soft and complex as they come."
"Made for the long haul, this 100% Cab was fermented in 100% new French oak. Right now, it's a hard, tannic wine, with little to relieve the astringency. The dominant flavors are of primary fruit black currants and sweet, charred wood. The score reflects the current drinkability, but it's a wine that could improve dramatically over the years."
"Too soft and Porty, with sweet blackberry jam and chocolate flavors. There's also a burn from high alcohol."
"Dry and earthy, with blackberry, licorice, bacon, herb, tobacco and smoky oak flavors. At its best now, so drink up."
"Shows the lush richness, dryness and complexity you want in a fine Napa Valley Cabernet. At more than six years of age, the tannins are just beginning to resolve, although they're still pretty fierce. But the flavors are beautiful, showing classic blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, plums and cedar. Drink now–2015."
"Made in the modern, soft, cult style of extreme ripeness, this Cab is super-rich in pastry-filling blackberries, cherries and chocolate. It's at its best now."
"Tannins mark this tough, still young wine from beginning to end. The astringency envelops the fruit, giving the mouthfeel a hard, dry astringency. Even though there are some well-developed blackberry and currant flavors, the wine is unrelieved in harshness. Try cellaring until at least 2013, but it's risky."
"A massive wine that absolutely demands time in the cellar, Lancaster's '05 is nearly all Cabernet, with tiny amounts of the other four Bordeaux varieties. It stuns with the power and authenticity of its hilly Cabernet origins, offering vast black currant, orange rind, anise and smoky oak flavors that implode on the palate. But the tannins are hard. It should blossom and fully come into its own after 2010."
"There's a ton of Cabernet flavor here. The California sunshine of this warm appellation ripened the grapes to cassis and black cherry perfection. The oak and tannin structure is polished and fine, but acidity is a little low, so it's not an ager. Drink now through 2009 for its sheer lusciousness."
"An elegant Cabernet that's ready to drink tonight and will hold for some years. Shows good Napa character, with lush, ripe tannins and flavors of black currants, blackberries and cedar that cry out for a good steak."
"This dramatically structured Cab needs time in the cellar. It straddles the old-fashioned style of long-aging and the modern style of immediate opulence. The tannins star, sticky and firm, but the wine, which contains minor amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, is so rich, so loaded in black currants, cherries, sweet ripe plums, chocolate, anise and smoky oak, that it seduces now. But best after the age of six."
"Here's a firm young Cab that desperately needs time in the cellar. Its tannins push and shove the palate, stinging and shutting it down. But there's a deep core of terrifically ripe black currants, and the oak application is fancy. Only 150 cases produced. Best after 2011 and possibly for many years after."
"This is a very fine, high level Cabernet that shows the impeccable nature of Mondavi Reserve. Yet it's also very tannic and far from being drinkable. Shows a vast repository of black currant, blackberry, black cherry and new oak flavors wrapped into a smooth, velvety mouthfeel whose finish goes on forever. Masculine and authoritative, it should continue to improve for many years. Drink now, with decanting, and through 2017, at least."
"Young and unintegrated, this Cab is nowhere near ready to drink. The sweet oak sticks out, overpowering the ripe blackberry, currant and herb flavors. Needs time. Give it until after 2009, at the earliest."
"Ripe, dry and oaky, with powerful black currant and cedar flavors. Shows its youth in the astringency of the tannins, which are fine but very hard. Could be a sleeper. Try after 2011."
"Clos du Val has gone as far as they intend to in order to make a ripe, opulent Cab in the modern Napa cult style. But they remain faithful to their Bordeaux-inspired house style, which is leaner and more tannic than most. The result is a natural cellar candidate, with an official alcohol of only 13.5%. Rich in blackberries and black currants, this wine should easily develop over the next 10–15 years."
"Nice and dry, with rich mountain tannins and focused, concentrated blackberry and black currant flavors that finish with a dark chocolate and spice flourish. Dense and full-bodied, it should develop over the next 2–3 years."
"Famed winemaker Cathy Corison brings her restrained touch to this Cabernet for Lookout Ridge's guest winemaker series, which benefits charity. It's a dry, tannic wine that's a little too young to drink now. But it's classically proportioned, with lush currant and cedar flavors. Made from Corison's Kronos Vineyard, it will be best after 2011."
"This is a New World, cult-style Cab whose high alcohol creates an impression of sweetness, but not of heat. It's succulent and delicious, a mouthful of black currants, cherry jam and milk chocolate that's balanced with lush tannins and acidity. Drink this decadent wine now."
"The name is apropos, for this is a big, fleshy wine, almost like one of those Aussie Shirazes in jammy fruit, although it's Cabernet all the way with blackberries and currants. With fine tannins and a smooth finish, it shows quite a bit of sophistication."
"Lots of smoky, spicy oak on this wine. The wood is the dominant feature right now, overshadowing the blackberry, cherry,  cassis and cocoa flavors. The mountain tannins also are strong, suggesting ageability. Should hold and soften through 2012."
"A little harsh in texture, but otherwise a pretty nice, dry Cabernet that should benefit from decanting. From the esteemed producer, Goldschmidt, it's filled with briary flavors of blackberries and cherries."
"Feels harsh and tart in the mouth, with sharp acidity that gives the oaky-cherry flavors the taste of Chinese sweet-and-sour sauce."
"The winery's '05 Cab is tannic and dry and elegant. It tastes like a young Bordeaux, a wine that needs time in the cellar to come around. The flavors are classic Napa Cab, all black currants, black cherries and oak. Just beautiful. Best after 2009, but good now with decanting and a big, important steak."
"Despite significant youthful tannins this Cab has such deep, ripe flavor that you can drink it now. The mouthfeel is astringent and hard, in the way of a young wine, but waves of cherries, blackberries and currants flatter the tastebuds, and it also softens as it warms up in the glass. A beautiful, polished drink that should develop over the next eight years."
"This is a wine to cellar. It's just too hard in tannins now to perform well, even though it has very deep and impressive flavors, such as crushed blackberries and cherries, cassis, violets, anise, dark chocolate and cedar. Shows a great return to form after a few under-performing years. Best after 2010."
"It would be a pity to open this wine anytime before, say, 2010, because it needs age. Now, and for a while, it will taste closed and tannic and raw. But such are the tannins and acids and overall balance, and the core of blackberries and cherries is so rich, that it should effortlessly negotiate the next decade."
"Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah. Like its predecessors, it's very dry, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, and new oak plays only a supporting role. It's really an elegant wine and a great value at this price."
"Give this young puppy a few years to shed its babyfat. It's a bit tannic and hard now, although the blackberry, currant and cedar flavors are just fine. But it's not a longterm ager due to some raisining."
"From a label owned by William Grant & Sons, this rich Napa Cab meets expectations with its fine tannic structure and ripe, oak-influenced flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and spice. As sweet as the wine is in the mouth, it actually finishes thoroughly dry."
"A beautiful young Cab that continues Salvestrin's unbroken track record of the last several years. Dry and rich in tannins, it shows enormously concentrated fruit flavors of currants, blackberries, black cherries, mocha and spice. Gorgeous now, and should improve over the next decade."
"Quite a good Napa Valley Cabernet, with a complex tannin structure and tiers of blackberry, black currant, orange zest, Provençal herb, violet and anise flavors, and a touch of raisins on the finish. Don't be alarmed by the sediment it's already throwing in the glass. Feels somewhat sharp, which lowers the point score."
"Dry and softly tannic, this Cab is ready to drink now. It offers blackberry, black and red currant, licorice and sage flavors, with a touch of smoky new oak."
"Very good price for a Cab of this quality. It's dry and full-bodied, with ripe, attractive flavors of blackberry jam, cherries, minty chocolate and smoky oak."
"A little raw and chunky, with jammy currant and cassis flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. The finish is dry and astringent, suggesting modest ageability."
"The winery made its bones with its fabulous Sacrashe Cabernet from Rutherford. This is their first release from Diamond Mountain, and the result is quite interesting. In fact, it's very good, but disappointing, considering the price. The wine is firm and hard in tannins, with blackberry, currant and new oak flavors, yet it's a little lacking in depth. Could be an ager, but don't bet the farm."
"Robust in tannins, with crisp, fruity acidity, this Cab has very ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors that have seen their share of smoky oak. It's a good wine but an edgy one. Could develop in the bottle after a couple years."
"Lots of forward blackberries, cherries, currants and mocha in this ripe wine. It's a bit rustic in the softness and simple structure, though."
"Made in a ripe, extracted style, this pleasant Cab-Merlot blend has flavors of currants, plums, cedar and spice. Seems at its best now and for a couple years."
"Tastes direct and ripe, with pie-filling, almost sweet flavors of blackberries, black cherries and smoky oak. Could improve over the short term."
"A good wine, but a little awkward and brooding, all sharp elbows and knees. The tannins are edgy, and the currant, mint and cedar flavors are all over the place. Ungainly now, but could improve with a few years in the cellar."
"The wine is enormously ripe, a lip-smackingly fruity 100% Cab that seduces the palate with massive black currant, licorice, sweet date and cedar flavors. Yet it has a tannic astringency that suggests, although it does not require, aging. Should develop well for at least a decade."
"Other wineries come and go. Raymond remains, offering solid Napa Valley Cab at a fair price. The '05 Reserve calls to mind the very fine 2000, but actually costs less. It's a dry, elegantly structured wine, rich in sweet fine tannins, and offering up complex, delicious flavors of freshly picked ripe blackberries, spicy cassis, baked cherry pie and smoky oak. Drink now through 2015."
"The Dierberg family worked hard before releasing this Cab, which comes from the warmest part of the appellation. It's quite a good wine, soft and rich and immediately likeable for its array of black currant, licorice and mocha flavors. The 100% new French oak is just right in smoke and cedary vanilla. The next step is to build in layers of density and complexity, but this is a huge step forward for Santa Ynez Valley Cabernet Sauvignon."
"Surh Luchtel knows how to make a great Cab. The '05 is a beautiful wine, softly complex and layered, with black currant, cherry, mocha, sweet oak and spicy flavors. But it's tannins that really mark this wine. They're so fine, so authoritative. Drink now–2010."
"This bottling from Napa veteran St. Clement has been variable in recent years. The '05 is similar to the '02. It's a likeable, elegant Cab that drinks well now. The cherry, blackberry, plum and mocha flavors are wrapped into rich, soft tannins."
"Very ripe, with powerful grilled blackberry, cassis and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into strong tannins. The large vineyard is up on Atlas Peak, and the wine shows the slightly rustic, pugnacious quality that can mark Cabs of the appellation. Give it a few years to mellow."
"Drier and earthier than many Napa Cabs these days, this wine has subtle sage and sweet licorice that grounds its fruitier flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Very beautiful are the tannins, which are rich and pure, suggesting perfect ripeness. The small Bosché bottling has been a premier one for the winery for many years, and this '05 is one of the best in memory. Should age effortlessly for at least a dozen years."
"The winery released its regular '05 Cabernet nearly two years ago. Now comes the Reserve. It was worth the wait. The tannins are beginning to resolve, making the wine approachable now. It has tremendously rich flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and cedar, and should continue to develop through 2011."
"This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle."
"A monumental Cabernet that succeeds on every level. It's deep, dark and ultrarich, showing massive blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, violets, minerals and a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Beyond the flavors is the dramatic structure, with fabulously ripe, dense tannins and a bone-dry, long finish. Surely a tremendous wine capable of long-term aging. Try 2012–2018, at least."
"Cabernet doesn't get bigger than this. It's an immense wine, explosive in blackberry, black currant, cedar and spice flavors, with immaculate Oakville tannins. Right up there with the best. Refined and exquisite on release, even without decanting, it will easily negotiate many years in the cellar."
"Dry and dusty, this lovely Cab shows red cherry sour candy, red currant, violet flower and smoky cedar flavors. The tannins are significant. It's a wine that needs time, but it should be very fine after 2011 and for several years after."
"Spicy, smoky new oak leaps out of the glass, like a blast of caramelized meringue, but the fruit is so rich that the oak is in balance. The underlying flavors of blackberries, licorice and chocolate are, in a word, delicious. Now through 2011."
"Shows all the hallmarks of a wine that will improve with mid-term aging. The flavors leap out now, and are all about ripe, crushed blackberries, red and black currants, anise and sweet, smoky cedar. Yet there's a tannic interference that's a little hard and astringent. Decant, if you have to open, but should hit its stride after 2009."
"This is obviously a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows the pedigree and class you expect from a winery of Staglin's level, enormously rich in black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, with ripe, soft and complex tannins. But the price is challenging. If you choose to buy and cellar, the wine should develop at least for several years."
"Tastes tired, with dried out tannins framing blackberry and oak flavors. Interesting, but catch it now before it goes further downhill."
"Fritz has made tremendous progress with Cab over the years, and their '05 represents an exciting new step. It's true to the variety, a smoothly dry, tannic wine that brims with currants, cherries and cocoa. Yet it showcases the brambly, briary, peppery notes you find in the best Dry Creek Valley Cabs."
"This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now."
"A nice Cabernet for this everyday price. Dry and smooth, it shows interesting flavors of black currants, plums, herbs and spice, with a touch of smoky oak."
"A little tough and gritty, but okay for everyday fare. Shows blackberry, currant, tobacco and herb flavors that turn sweetly fruity on the finish."
"A very fine Cabernet, dry and firm, but it needs a little time in the cellar. Astringent now, it has a deep core of black currants and cedar, with the polished tannins that Napa so easily crafts. Try between 2010–2012."
"A bit disjointed, with acidity sticking out, and the fruit tending toward jammy blackberries, raspberries and nectarines, leading to sharpness in the finish. Could mellow and improve in a couple years."
"Andy Beckstoffer is starting to release wines from his Red Hills vineyards, and this release is promising, especially at this price. It's fruity and tasty in blackberries and cherries, while oak adds rich notes of caramel and vanilla. Rich and savory, this Cab delivers lots to like."
"Compared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010."
"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine."
"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ‘05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years."
"This young, vigorous Cabernet is full of ripe, upfront fruity flavors, yet it's dry and complex, and is grounded by a pleasing tug of herbaceousness. Most notable is the rich blackberry, raspberry and currant fruit, and the way the sweet, smoky oak complements it. Drink now for freshness."
"Very dark in color, this jumps out at first because it's showy and high in alcohol, with seemingly sweet overtones that might appeal to lovers of brawny red wine.The oak, green pepper and olive undertones take over on the finish."
"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012."
"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges."
"From the prestigious Rutherford appellation comes this soft, smooth and mellow Cabernet, with delicious flavors of black cherry, cola and beef teriyaki. It shows just a trace of bitterness on the finish, so drink soon."
"What a great wine for the price. It's made from various Napa mountain vineyards, and shows concentrated blackberry and black currant flavors, wrapped into superfine Napa tannins that go down with silky smoothness. Not cheap, but the price is a bargain compared to superexpensive Napa Cabs. At nearly 6,000 cases produced, it's a steal."
"Harrison's Cabernet is a bit hard in youth, marked by strong tannins that make for an astringent mouthfeel. It's also somewhat linear in varietal flavor, with ripe black currants and blackberries and a certain minerality. Not drinkable now, but all indications are for a good future. Better after 2012."
"Simple and sugary, with blackberry and cherry jam flavors and a solid plaster of sweet, caramelized oak. Production was 20,000 cases."
"A good Cabernet, if a little gritty, with herb-infused flavors of black currants, plums and spices. Might soften with a few years in the bottle, but not really a longterm ager."
"Soft and tannic, with a sour candy-sweet taste, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise and cedar. Drink now."
"Released at just a little over a year old, this demonstrates the promise of Lake County for Cabernet. It's a dry, polished and enjoyable wine, with a fine tannin-acid structure and good flavors of blackberries, currants, black cherries and smoky oak."
"Ripe and forward in the modern cult style, with flavors of blackberry tart, black currants, milk chocolate and ripe mulberry, in addition to sweet, smoky oak. Sturdy mountain tannins provide structural bite, and should help the wine mature beyond 2011."
"Strong, almost overpowering in fruit, which dominates at the cost of balance. Shows massive blackberries, currants and cherries, as well as sweet oak, but you wish there were more subtlety."
"What a fine, beautiful wine this is. Shows every graceful aspect of a modern Napa Cab, from the perfectly ripened fruit to the unbelievably fine tannins and application of oak. Thrills the mouth with decadently rich black currants, crême de cassis, milk chocolate, anise and cedar flavors, but never loses an impeccable sense of balance and control. Best now, even without decanting, and through 2014."
"Here's an important new Cabernet that instantly takes its place in the increasingly crowded Napa pantheon. It's extraordinarily rich in black currants, chocolate, anise, pepper and cedar flavors that are wrapped into perfectly ripened tannins. Feels lush, plush and smooth in the mouth, and should age effortlessly for a decade or more."
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a best barrels selection. It's the densest, most tannic of David Arthur's current releases, a massive wine stuffed with black currants, blackberries, anise, tobacco and smoky new oak. Best of all, it's dry, dry, dry. Fine now, if you're into young wines, but should age well in a good cellar for many years."
"Outstanding for its purity, and the incredibly fine tannins, not to mention the compelling flavors. Black and red cherries, currants, cola, mushrooms, cedar, anise, and spice flavors mingle into a long, rich finish. So balanced and elegant. Made from 95% Sacrashe Vineyard fruit, in the Rutherford AVA."
"As ripely fruity and oaky as any Cab out there, offering a flood of blackberries, currants, cherries, raspberries, mocha and sweet, smoky new oak. Yet lifted up by the tannin-inspired structure and a welcome, herbaceous note of olives. Marries the best of the old and new styles, a terrific Cabernet that will develop for 6–8 years."
"Tasted alongside far more expensive Napa Cabs, this one held its own proudly. It shows impressive blackberry, currant and mint flavors, with a smoky, ashy overlay of oak. The firm tannins suggest modest ageability. Drink this dry, balanced Cab now through 2010."
"At more than four years of age, this Cabernet is as good as it will ever be. It's soft and gentle in black raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with a sugary sweet finish."
"Made with a splash of Cabernet Franc, this wine is soft, a little sweet and oaky. Fifty percent new French barrels shows up in the form of butterscotch and vanilla, while the underlying grape flavors of blackberries and cherries are tasty. Drink now."
"The tannins are still hard as nails in this five-year-old Cabernet. It's like chewing on sandpaper, but the black currant and cassis flavors are powerful. An old-fashioned wine that could develop over the years."
"Lots of charm now for the roasted coffeebean, red cherry, pain grillé and sandalwood aromas and flavors that are wrapped into finely ground tannins. Shows real class and elegance despite its mountain tightness. Should develop bottle complexities through 2014 or or so."
"This is a big, tannic and dry Cabernet, but it's very elegant, and shows the pedigree of Alexander Valley at its best. Impeccably balanced in acidity and tannins, the fruit is pure blackberries and black currants, with a wonderful earthiness suggesting dried sage and thyme. Should develop nicely over the next 6–8 years."
"A lovely Cabernet that shows the soft tannins and earthy herbaceousness of Alexander Valley. On a fruitier note are the cherries and red currants that are accented by sweet, smoky oak. Spicy and dry, this polished wine wants a few years in the cellar. 2011–2015."
"Good Cabernet Sauvignon, spicy, full  bodied and fruity. It's a little gritty and rustic in the mouth, with the blackberry and cherry flavors turning jammy sweet. Drink now."
"Rich blackberry purée, blueberry jam, raspberry pie, cherry tart and cedar flavors in this Cab. Rather direct in its appeal, and a bit too sweet, but its solid New World style will appeal to some."
"A little harsh in mouthfeel, with some minty green notes that give it the flavor of sweet-and-sour cherry and currant sauce. Needs a cheeseburger to tame it."
"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy. For some reason, the winery lowered the price considerably from the 2005, which was a much better wine."
"Hard and tough in tannins now, with a dry astringency. It's a good, balanced Cabernet, with very rich blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, but those gritty tannins are difficult. Give it a few years in the cellar."
"Bone dry and earthy, this Cab shows modest flavors of blackberries, currants and mocha. It's a clean, affordable wine that's good for an everyday red."
"A hard wine to like, although it's clean and without technical flaws. Tastes very oaky now, with hard grapeskin and oak tannins giving an astringency to the superripe blackberry and cherry jelly flavors."
"Tough and tannic now, although it's fully dry, and the tannins are finely sculpted. Shows deep flavors of blackberries, currants, cocoa and spices. There's a hint of funkiness that may detract from ageability."
"Fancy and easy to drink now for its soft tannins and elegant mouthfeel. Flavors of blackberries, black currants, black cherries, dark chocolate, herbs and sweet tobacco flood the mouth, and are complex and flattering. But the tannins are such that time in the cellar is recommended. Now–2012."
"Von Strasser continues to produce stunning Cabernets that are not only delicious when released, but ageable. This estate bottling is superbly rich in cassis and cedar, and while the tannins are thick, they're sweet and intricate. Great now and should develop through 2012, at least."
"If hedonism is what you like in a Cab, you'll love this lush bottling from Peju. It's softly delicious, offering waves of complex blackberries, blueberries, currants, sandalwood and sweet milk chocolate. Outstanding, and easy to find, with 10,000 cases produced."
"At the age of seven-plus years, this 100% Cabernet is at the peak of its drinkability. It's dry and medium-bodied, and the blackberry and cherry fruit is drying out and turning leathery, with high alcohol poking through."
"Shows the soft tannins and slight herbal quality of a top Alexander Valley Cab, along with low-yield mountain concentration of red and black currants, mocha and spice. Drink this polished, supple wine through 2012."
"Good and smooth, with complex Napa tannins and flavors of black currants and cedar along with a firm earthy minerality that must come from the soil. A bit tannic and distant, though. Needs some time. Better after 2011, but not a longterm ager."
"A very likeable Cabernet Sauvignon, easily up there with the best of Easton's Cabs. The wine is dry and rich in fruit, with finely ground tannins housing ripe blackberry and black currant flavors. Should develop in the bottle over the next 2–4 years."
