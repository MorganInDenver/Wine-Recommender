Description
"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age."
"This Chard has always been dependably rich, and here's another tasty offering, with powerful scents of tropical fruits and Oriental spices, and leesy-smoky notes of butter and vanilla. You'll especially enjoy the creamy texture, accented with peach, pineapple and spicy-buttery flavors. The finish is long and rich, too."
"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes. Marked by intense tropical fruit aromas and oriental spices, it also tastes very rich. It's the best of a very good trio of limited-production Chardonnay wines."
"This massively oaky wine smells like an explosion in a spice factory, with ginger, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg aromas, accented by vanilla, brown sugar, butterscotch and honey. Somewhere in there is some ripe tropical fruit. Enormous and full-bodied, it's a dense, unctuous wine."
"After you've had oceans of Chardonnay and don't think there's room for a drop more, along comes a wine like this to change your mind. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture. It's all of these together, in a balanced package."
"A tremendously rich, oaky Chard that will blast your socks off and then some. The fruit is really complex, ranging from green apples to savory ripe peaches on into tropical fruit, and there's a dusty sprinkling of cinnamon and ginger. For sur-lie freaks, there's lots of creamy, yeasty, nutty notes contributing to this delicious, hard-hitting wine."
"They took only the best fruit they could find for this expensive wine, and made only 1,280 cases of it. Using every Burgundian trick in the book, winemaker Steve Test has created a rich, creamy wine, long on smoky oak and yeasty lees, with impressive spice and fruit that veers toward peaches and more tropical notes."
"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow."
"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities. It drinks quite a bit softer, though, with lower acidity, which makes it seem richer, fatter, and more user friendly. You can taste the pretty fruit on the finish."
"A very distinctive Chard—full of character and even eccentricity. There are strong, up-front aromas of tangerines, vanilla, butterscotch, smoke, ripe peaches and caramel. It's especially notable for the thick, creamy texture and a penetrating, spicy clove note that follows through on the long, rich finish. A complex, serious wine."
"Golden yellow in color, this 16-year-old sparkler presents uniquely pleasant aromas of corn bread, chamomile and yellow flowers. It's not powerfully effervescent, but manages to strike up a rich bubbly cream on the palate, with flavors of corn tortilla and Meyer lemon making for memorable sipping."
"Has very tight fruit, but it's deeply appley, with opulent cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger spice. Also drinks spicy and rich. Has a wonderfully deft, supple mouthfeel, and is quite dry. A fine example of a North Coast Chard that's clean and well crafted."
"Toasty, smoky aromas from new oak come close to concealing shy apples and citrus fruits, but the strong spicy flavors assert themselves on the palate. A very long finish completes the picture."
"Marked by powerful oak influences and sur-lie aging, this Kunde offering features strong, forward aromas of the ripest pears and apples, but maintains a light quality on the palate."
"A richly fruity wine marked by tropical fruit and spice aromas and flavors, and a rich, creamy texture. Has a slight burn in the mouth from alcohol and spice that calls out for food."
"Deep, layered aromas of smoky honey, lees and the ripest peaches. In the mouth, it's satisfyingly complex: dry, with a huge blast of fruit, honey, spice and a creamy texture. The finish lasts a long time."
"Strong , complex aromas, with notes of tropical fruit and coconut. In the mouth, it's oaky and spicy, with penetrating, bright, effusive flavors that you might go so far as to call racy. The alcohol content is high and it drinks a little soft, but this is a very seductive wine. A crowd-pleaser, for sure."
"Despite the broad appellation, South Coast fruit seems to dominate in the tropical fruit aromas, accompanied by a generous dose of spicy, vanilla-tinged oak. Similarly tastes very ripe and fruity, although has noticeable sweetness."
"Has slight but clean wildflower and peach aromas, and drinks light but fruity, with apple and peach notes. Seems a little off-dry, but with adequate acidity. Nothing wrong with this low-priced, everyday-style wine."
"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish."
"Here's a nice everyday drinking wine with some real richness from ripe Chardonnay grapes and a touch of toasty oak. It will satisfy that craving for apple and peach-flavored fruit. Dry and spicy, with the creamy texture of a good wine, but it won't break the bank."
"Defines Carneros in its rich, nuanced aromas of fig, ripe peach, tangerine, nutmeg and oaky vanilla. Winemaker-induced complexities from barrel fermentation and lees aging. Tremendous depth of flavor, it just sings on the palate and is so rich and spicy. The ultralong finish is sweet and satisfying."
"A rich blend that features toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch on the nose. On the palate, it serves up a pleasing lineup of melon, apple, honey, spice and toast flavors. Creamy rich on the finish, fleshy and seductive. -J.M."
"Clearly an older wine, picking up a bottle bouquet of dried herbs, lees and yeast, riding on top of basic peach, pear and tropical fruits. Drinks very dry and crisp. The fruit is beginning to fade, leaving behind flavors of dried leaves, herbs, minerals and spice. An interesting wine of considerable nuance and subtlety."
"This ripe, lovely wine shows classic Russian River Valley aromas of ripe, sweet, green apples. The winemaking adds smoky, vanilla-scented oak, a creamy, leesy smoothness and a rich softness that owes to malolactic fermentation. What strikes you, though, is the balance. All the parts come together in this super-enjoyable wine. At this price, it's a great value."
"Pretty standard stuff here, with thin, watery aromas that carry only faint traces of wood and apples, and watery flavors. It's clean, but hot from alcohol, with high acidity. —S.H."
"Held back probably to tame fierce acidity, and it's still a young, lean, tart wine. Fresh, juicy flavors of lemons drink very clean and vibrant, but it's austere stuff. Try with goat cheese on toast."
"With this wine, Callaway takes a step away from its longtime Temecula appellation and toward the increasingly well-regarded Coastal designation. The wine is a little oakier than Callaway's previous bottlings and the fruit is lean, tending toward grapefruit and green apple. It's crisp and ultraclean, and a good value."
"White Merlot? Why not? It's actually a deep rose color, with fresh, exuberant aromas of raspberries and wildflowers. Drinks fruity and clean, with nice strawberry and raspberry flavors and just a tad of sugar. The finish is pretty."
"A blast of clean, ripe citrus, peach and pear fruit greets you from this well-made, if simple, wine. There are vanilla and smoke elements from wood. It's a little soft, and a tad off-dry, but if you need a case of something white to quench the throats of party-goers who aren't real particular, this is the ticket."
"With a hefty case production, the wine is light and thin, but there are pleasant enough flavors. It's average Chardonnay, with just enough appley fruit, oak and sweetness to satisfy. It's clean and well-made, and there's not much more you can say about it."
"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor."
"Ripe, tropical fruit aromas mark this spicy, well-made wine. The aromas veer toward breadfruit, mango and even banana, with Oriental spice notes of ginger and cinnamon. Drinks rich and powerful, with up-front fruit, and finishes long and spicy."
"This is the workhorse release from an always dependable producer, and it's excellent. Not enormously complex or layered, but very ripe; it offers up-front peach flavors veering into tropical fruit, with a solid dose of smoky oak that adds nuance. Vibrant and alive, with high acidity that endows it with marvelous structure."
"If you didn't know the price and had to guess, you'd probably figure this wine would cost about $18. It's enormously ripe and fruity, with bright peach, tropical fruits and spices and quite a bit of oak. The technical notes say it was partially barrel-fermented. A wine of enormous charm and a great value in Chardonnay."
"Tight and sulky right now, showing little more than earth and minerals on the nose. Later, it opens up to reveal apple and pear fruit along with some oily flavors. Finishes with citrus and green apple. Hang out the “Do Not Disturb” sign; this crisp, flavorful Chard could use another year or two of cellaring."
"Barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging add buttery, creamy, spicy complexities to this clean, steely wine. The underlying fruity flavors are not intense and veer toward leaner citrus and green apple flavors. It's a focused wine, not overblown. —S.H."
"Seems somewhat crisper and less weighty than prior vintages, with the custardy mouthfeel buttressed by lemony acids. You'll also find apples, sweet plums and the obligatory toast and vanilla. —J.C."
"A nice, lush wine with a lot of smoky oak and lees framing well-ripened apple and peach flavored fruit. Feels rich and creamy in the mouth, and oriental spices tingle the  palate on the long finish."
"A flamboyant Chard, packed with tropical fruit flavors and with a lavish overlay of smoky oak. Drinks crisp and clean in the mouth, with a creamy texture and a long, spicy finish. Could use a bit more finesse and subtlety, but glamorous and enticing."
"A bizarre wine weird-aromas and flavors. Smells smoky-sweet, like cotton candy, with mint and peach puree, and has similar flavors. Hard to tell if it's dry or sweet."
"Buttered toast, yeast and a hint of nut wrap around warm fruit aromas. A creamy blend of peach and citrus brighten this viscous, full-bodied wine that closes with a clean flinty zip. It is this acidity that well pairs the wine to any summertime fare."
"There are some Chard elements in this rustic, countrified wine. The apple and peach flavors, with oaky vanilla overtones, are familiar. But itÕs a rough wine, with some odd, vegetal qualities. Satisfactory, if youÕre not very fussy."
"A rich, oaky wine easily as good as Chards that cost far more, it has aromas and flavors of ripe white peaches and Delicious apples, and scads of oriental spice. Avoids excessive sweetness, although oak tannins and glycerin make it round and soft. —S.H."
"A nutty, leesy wine that takes those positive attributes to the limit, resulting in a mix of flavors that range from peanut brittle to lemon custard. The delicate melon and citrus fruit ends up getting a little overwhelmed."
"Packs more flavor than any other two wines put together. This fruit bomb explodes on the palate with limes, tangerines,  peaches and the sweetest green apples and papayas, and it's all creamy and spicy. It feels dryish until you swallow, when a peacock's tail of sugar fans out on the way down. —S.H."
"The flavors in this kosher wine are very rich, commingling tangerines, ripe peaches, and mangoes for a thoroughly mouth-filling experience. Oak adds smoky, spicy notes. ItÕs a bit sweet, and could use more bright acid because itÕs too soft right through the finish."
"Winemaker Doug Meador says this is not a “California Fats” Chardonnay, by which he means he went light on the oak and allowed the fruit to speak for itself. It's pretty fruit, with the smell and taste of apples. However, that slight touch of oak adds just the right amount of vanilla and cream to the mix. —S.H."
"Interesting to taste Saintsbury's Reserve next to the regular Chardonnay. Both naturally share the same taste and textural characteristics, but this wine is oakier and softer in the mouth, especially in acidity. It lacks the crispness and zest of the regular. Seems a bit heavy and flat, although it's still a nice wine."
"Great structure, with crisp, supportive acids and a fine overlay of oak that seasons but doesn't overwhelm. The flavors are quite lean. The winemaker calls them mineral-like, but it's more like grapefruits and lemons. The main problem with this well-made wine is, in fact, this lack of flavor."
"A smooth, classy Chardonnay, this wine strikes a fine balance between elegance and strength. Framed in toasty oak, it shows off plenty of pretty citrus, pear, apple and herb flavors, finishing clean and long with a mineral edge."
"A terrifically flamboyant wine, filled with jazzy flavors that impress for their sheer hedonism. Peaches and pears veer way over to tropical fruits, and there's a lot of oak and lees to boot. The rich, creamy texture leads to a long, spicy finish in this young, delicious wine."
"This is a soft, creamy Chardonnay that's reminiscent of baked apples loaded with cinnamon and perked up with a few curls of orange zest. Finishes long, with creamy vanilla supported by orange echoes. —J.C."
"Textbook RRV Chard reveals green apple and intense spice, white peach and honey flavors, generously wrapped in smoky oak. Has a real richness and creaminess to the texture. Finishes too sugary, but has a lip-smacking quality many will admire. —S.H."
"A really good, complex Chard, at the forefront of this varietal's development in California. Combines ripe flavors of sweet, spicy tropical fruits with cool-climate acidity and structure to produce an addictively drinkable, delicious wine. The oak is thickly applied, but perfectly in balance. A desert island wine: If you could bring only one with you..."
"Smooth and distinguished, a flamboyant wine with enough flavor to last all day. Peaches, pears and tropical fruits are encased in lush, toasty oak, while lees adds a creamy, mealy texture. This classy wine is rich and balanced."
"A blend of lots that didn't make it into the single-vineyard Chardonnays, the Sonoma Coast bottling offers a representative introduction to the Hartford Chardonnay style. Oily-textured melons and peaches are framed by toasty, nutty, buttery accents."
"Much leaner than the ‘99 vintage. This release shows mineral, slate, and citrus fruit  flavors and high acidity, and is very dry. Feels like liquid steel gliding over the palate, ultra-clean and tart. No creme brulee this year, but nonetheless a distinguished wine."
"Marked by extreme oak, with charred, vanilla-infused aromas and spicy wood flavors. The underlying fruit is hard to discern under all that wood, but seems to veer toward peaches. Slightly sweet, with good acidity, it will please those who think oak and Chardonnay are synonymous. —S.H."
"From R.H. Phillips, itÕs a shade oakier and more refined than their regular bottling. The peach flavors are more concentrated, and sappier, but it comes at the cost of crispness. The wine sags in the mouth, like a Dali melted watch. But it tastes good."
"Loads of sweet pineapple and vanilla mark this richly succulent wine. Super-concentrated fruity flavors blast the palate, leading to a long finish. For all its ripeness, the wine is dry. Strong and tasty stuff!"
"Bizarre and unripe. Aromas of canned peaches with a strong note of the veggies, especially asparagus. The oaky overlay feels unnatural, with disembodied smoke and char flavors. Tart and acidic, and that vegetal taste returns to haunt the finish."
"Vegetal and herbal, with disageeable aromas of canned white asparagus. Tastes a little better than it smells, but hardly like a Chardonnay. Flavors are citrusy, and the wine is lean and tart."
"Hits all the right notes, from the rich, sweet tropical fruit to the butter and toast accents, but like the third violin in the symphony, lacks that extra flair to really stand out. The oak is well proportioned, and some zesty lime notes that should make it reasonably versatile with food grace the finish. —J.C."
This is a good wine that's weakened by a lack of harmony. The fruit veers toward mangoes and breadfruit. The acids are fine. A gentle overlay of oak and pronounced lees add textural complexity. Yet the parts don't come together smoothly; it feels jagged in the mouth. —S.H.
"Another sweet, oaky Chardonnay joins the ever-growing line. Not that it's an indifferent wine. This family produces nothing but impeccably tailored wines, and this one is among the best of class at this price point. —S.H."
"It's all about extract in this kick-in-the-pants Chard. Assaults the palate with oversized fruit and the sting of peppery spice. Words like bright, electric and bold come to mind. It's also sweet and oaky. —S.H."
"User-friendly Chard, all toasty-spicy apples, and peaches and cream. There's almond-skin bitterness in the aftertaste that sort of sets your teeth on edge, but food will take care of that. —S.H."
"Interesting and compelling. Somehow the wine combines unctuous tropical fruit flavors with a crisp minerality. The whole of it is wrapped in rich, toasty oak, and there is quite a bit of acidity. One of the more food-friendly Chardonnays of the vintage."
"Quite austere, with citrusy, appley, minerally flavors and tart acids. This is not your usual fruit monster, although oak and lees do their best to add nuance and complexity. A good wine that is versatile at the table."
"Just like the barely drinkable regular release, only with an overlay of oak. Smells vegetal, and the thin flavors veer toward grapefruit."
"From Green Valley, the coolest part of the appellation, a wine with the most wonderful opening scents of ripe pears and the smoky perfume of oak. Perfectly delicious in the mouth, with pronounced pear flavors and a sleek note of minerality. A touch of lees adds a creamy texture but doesn't overwhelm. As opulent and lush as this wine is, it's delicate and elegant. Editors' Choice."
"A rich, opulent wine at an unbelievable price, this Chard has layers of ripe peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and a lush overlay of toasty oak. The wonderfully creamy texture leads to a long, spicy finish. Despite the statewide appellation, this is as good as many regional Chardonnays."
"Ripely fruity, with sun-warmed flavors of white peach and nectarine. Acids are fine, and boost the structure. There's also a subtle overlay of oak that adds to the tastes."
"Here's a rich, round Chard that delivers with its ripe, mouth-filling flavors. White peach, papaya, spicy fig, smoke, buttered toast, vanilla are accompanied by crisp, clean acidity. The intense finish lasts for a long time."
"Crisp acidity blends easily with creamy smooth texture here. This is a fine juxtaposition of mineral, apple, pear, spice and citrus flavors, neatly layered for complexity and eleganty structured. Long and bright at the end."
"Richly ripe, with flamboyant green apple and peach flavors, and lots of oak. Nice creamy texture, and dry. Notable for the lush quality of its acids, which make the wine crisp and tart through the finish."
"A bit on the lean side, with apple and citrus flavors, which are typical of the appellation. Acidity is also sharp and mouth-watering. This is not a big, fat Chardonnay but it is a well-structured, foodworthy wine, with oaky influences. This tight structure is very clean."
"A selection of the better barrels from the Home Ranch, the Reserve is fantastically rich and complex. No mere fruit bomb despite scads of flavors ranging from apples and peaches through pears and mangoes, there's also a sleek backbone of steel, all of it wrapped in a rich, honeyed texture. The finish is long and intricately constructed of dusty brown spices."
"Something special from the west side of the Salinas Valley, with its fogs and wind. Drinks very bright in acids and even some tannins that frame a melange of flavors, including sweet lime, green apple, and the ripest white peach. Tastes leesy and has the texture of sweet cream. This distinctive wine defines Monterey's interpretation of Chardonnay."
"This is stunningly good single-vineyard wine. The fruit shows well-ripened apples and peaches all the way into pineapples and mangoes, offering up a cascade of flavors that tumble across the palate. Oak shadings are generous, but in balance. Displays a crispness and delicacy of acids more usually associated with cooler regions. Absolutely first class."
"From a cool appellation, a wine that smells bright and clean, like the scent you get when slicing into a fresh peach. There's also a lot of young, toasty oak riding on top of the fruit. Long in the mouth and in the finish, this delicious wine has crisp, supporting acids."
"Almost always distinctive, and this year has unusual flair and finesse. Shows a Chablisian style of mineral, warm stone, and citrus, but with far richer streaks, like gold embedded in flint. Oak and lees are elegantly applied. More foodworthy than most California Chards."
"Beautiful young bubbly, light and elegant, with Chardonnay flavors of peaches and limes, enriched with leesy dough and smoky spice. The texture is ultrarefined, with a very fine mousse. This is one of the best, most complex Chandon bruts in a long time."
"Like a photocopy of a good Chardonnay, this wine is indistinct. There are some decent peach and apple flavors and what tastes like a dose of oak, but it's really thin and watery."
"A thin, uninspiring wine with citrus and apple sauce flavors and lots of acidity. Tastes watered down, but will do in a pinch."
"Super-delicious, a mouthful of Chardonnay perfection. Really notable for the pure concentration of its flavors, such as fresh ripe white peach, mango, and spicy fig. Elaborately oaked, but not too much to support the huge fruit. The rich and creamy texture is a delight."
"Lavish and bold, almost over the top in ripeness, and all those winemaker bells and whistles. Sweet mango and pineapple, vanilla custard, buttered toast and roasted hazelnut flavors swim in an opulently creamy texture. Yet it's fully dry and well balanced."
"Small mountain berries have yielded intense pear, peach and tropical fruit flavors, along with vanilla, butter, Oriental spices and toasted coconut. It's boldly oaked, too, with the creamy texture of a milkshake. A pure and beautiful expression of its place."
"Big, ripe, rich and well-oaked. That pretty much says it all about this show-offy wine, with its bold, tropical fruit flavors, crisp coastal acidity and sleek structure. The tart taste of minerally gunmetal adds complexity."
"An unbalanced wine despite some pretty apple and peach flavors, an overlay of oak, and a creamy smooth texture. The parts are nice but somehow they don't knit together and the wine feels disjointed. Turns quite bitter on the finish."
"Thin going here, with citrusy flavors and big, fresh Monterey acids. Seems to have some oak in it. Finishes dry and tart."
"Made in an earthier style. Not that there aren't exuberant flavors of apples, pears and peaches, but they're conjoined with notes of tobacco and herbs. Not especially oaky, but the smoke and vanilla complexities are just right."
"Not as rich or concentrated as the previous vintage, and the acidity is low, making for a mushy texture. Still, the peach and tropical fruit flavors are good. Turns hot with alcohol on the finish."
"This fruitywine has crisp acids and a pretty overlay of toasty oak. Drinks rich in apple, citrus and pear flavors, with a creamy texture, and is dry."
"Hard to get lushness and complexity into a Chard at this price, but this wine tries hard. It's a cool climate wine, to judge from the crisp, upfront acidity. Flavors veer toward apples and citrus fruits, and if there's any oak, it doesn't show. Finishes clean and lean."
"Another wonderfully complex wine from this single vineyard on the Napa side of the A.V.A. It's a tight, young wine, showing lime, apricot and mineral flavors. A sunburst of acidity marks the clean, dry finish. Oak and lees play supporting roles. It's likely this wine will improve over the long haul."
"Always a nice, rich Chard with oaky nuances but not too much. This year the wine is especially full-bodied, packed with fruity flavors and a spicy, cinnamon and pepper aftertaste. Cuvaison has held its prices down and this wine is actually a value in its class."
"Smooth and creamy textured, with lovely toast and spice notes up front. Melon, pear, apple, mandarine orange and lemon flavors are evenly balanced. The wine is crisp and clean on the finish, yet also long and fresh. -J.M."
"This is a big, rich Chardonnay, another monster lineup in Testarossa's single-vineyard series. Shows tightly knit apple and peach flavors very generously oaked, with the requisite additions of smoke, vanilla, and woody spices. There's something minerally in the middle that seems likely to preserve the wine, if you wish to age it. Very fine quality, and a super-good food wine."
"A very expressive and full-bodied wine. It jolts the palate with the purest extract of ripe limes, green apples and minerals. Wonderfully sharp acids push the flavors up and out, and cleanse the palate. Rather lean, compared to some of the fatties out there, a wine of structure and firmness.."
"Hard, lean and minerally, with mouth-tingling acidity and flavors of stone, herbs and citrus fruits. This is not one of your fat, hedonistic monsters, but will pair better with foods. The finish turns honeyed, with hints of peaches."
"Dry Creek Chards ask for a certain indulgence. They're never opulent or over the top, and have rather earthy flavors that bring to mind sweet, cured tobacco. This wine, which is a fine example, features winemaker interventions, like lees and oak, and finishes with some tannins. If you're adventurous, try aging it."
"This wine doesn't reveal much age at all, with fresh golden pear and tangerine rind aromas punched up with a hint of sour yeast. The yeast dominates the palate, though orange and rounded melon tones add to the full experience."
"A very fruity, exceptionally ripe wine, filled with sun-pure flavors of green apple, white peach, pear, and nutmeg. Oak plays a supporting role throughout. Finishes with a honey and pepper richness."
"A pleasant, citrusy Chardonnay, but one that is well-oaked, with the resulting aromas and flavors of vanilla and buttered toast. Lemon and lime flavors veer into riper peach, and are wrapped in a creamy texture. Acidity is quite high and bursts on the palate with a mouthwatering zest."
Milla Handley's estate wine is firmer and more acidic than her Sonoma bottling. It is a racy wine that brightens the palate with a malic acid edge of mineral. The flavor profile is thoroughly tart green apple. This crisp young wine will pair well with a wide range of food.
"From Gallo's Central Coast brand, a lean, tart and minerally Chardonnay marked by flavors of flint and lime just veering into tart green apple. Extremely well made, and not without interest, but if big, blowsy Chards are your thing, look elsewhere."
"Smells a little funky, with a meaty, raw beef aroma on top of scents of green apples. Tastes thin and watery, with a suggested of appley citrus fruit flavor. The finish turns tart and dry."
"Kicks off with hints of vanilla, honey, melon, peach, spice and citrus flavors. The wine is full bodied and viscous. It finishes with moderate length and a touch of spice at the end. -J.M."
"An amazing wine, so rich and unctuous it's like a late harvest dessert wine. May even have a little botrytis in the intense pear, banana and tropical fruit flavors, but it's really very dry. A whole lot of sweet oak pushes the volume even higher."
"This year the wine displays a tight structure of high acidity framing flavors of minerals, stones, and lime. On the finish a rich vein of tropical fruit and spice shows up. This young, steely wine possesses great authority and style, and may be an ager."
"Pretty thin going, almost like a Sauvignon Blanc with its tart, citrusy fruit flavors and high acidity. Not a bad wine, but if you're looking for a rich, oaky Chardonnay, shop around."
"The underlying fruit has flavors that veer toward green apple tart, with the baked, sweet taste of pie crust. Acids are crisp and uplifting. A generous overlay of oak and lees adds the final touches of buttercream and a rich texture to this nice, foodworthy wine."
"Has that pure appellation fruit taste of ripe green apples and sweet pears, framed in crisp acids. Feels bright and delicious in the mouth, accented with oak notes of vanilla and smoke. A creamy texture lends allure. This rich, hedonistic wine instantly appeals to the senses. Editors' Choice."
"Richer, riper and bigger than in the past, the usual green apple flavors veer into well-ripened pears and even tropical fruits, with spicy oak all over the place. Dry and sleek in texture, the kind of wine that despite its opulence feels ultra-clean through the finish. Good for Rochioli for leaving all these fresh, young acids."
"Always an interesting wine, Talbott's '03 Diamond T is so distinctive, it's almost eccentric. The candied apricots and cinnamon flavors have a baked pie-filling taste. With high acidity and a minerally edge, this Chard will develop nutty complexities over the next three to five years."
"Gallo has held this Chard more than 4 years before release; the reason may be an acidic tightness that still dominates the wine. It's deep in mineral-infused apricot and quince fruit. The barrel regimen consisted of 100% new oak. It's a big, absolutely dry, almost rasping wine, and may be one of those rare California Chards capable of aging. See what it does after 2008."
"The Audrey Cuvée brings extra richness to the regular Diamond T Estate Chard. It's an enormous wine that has honeyed sweetness. The flavors are of apricot jam, pineapple tart and lemon meringue, and new, smoky oak plays a prominant part. This Chard calls for careful pairing with food, since it's so rich, almost a dessert wine."
"A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish."
"A beat or two off the pace of previous vintages, the '04 is a little soft and one-dimensional. Tastes like it was baked by the heat, with jammy white and yellow fruit flavors that have a trace of bitterness."
"At about four years of age, Talbott's '04 tastes overripe. It has the aromas and flavors of a botrytized, late-harvest Chardonnay, brimming with apricot jam and pineapples, except that it's bone dry. With the very high acidity, this makes it unbalanced and not entirely enjoyable. This is a bottling that seems to do better in cooler vintages."
"Mount Eden's estate Chardonnay typically starts out life as a tight, nervous wine. It's marked by acidity and minerals, and you don't want to drink it too cold. The '04 is a lovely young wine, rich and dramatically complex, with layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, wet stone, creamy yeast and smoky oak, like an important Chablis. Brilliant now, it should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years."
"This is a barrel selection from the winery's Sleepy Hollow Vineyard and is one of the most concentrated Chardonnays in California. Has the honeyed richness of a botrytized wine, but is absolutely dry. Tastes like an apricot and pineapple tart, with seasonings of nutmeg, cinnamon, and the smoky, nutty pie crust. Very few California Chardonnays need time, but this one does. Stash until late 2008, but this powerhouse should gradually peak over a decade."
"An interesting and complex Chard marked by intense minerality. Calls to mind Chablis in the acidity, dryness and racy taste of cold steel. Also in the flavor mix are tart green apples, pineapples, limes, cinnamon spice and creamy lees."
"There's a decent wine here, crisp and ripe in pineapple flavor, but it's been buried under so much oak, it's practically invisible. The wine reeks of woodsap and charred barrels, dominated by a sweet vanilla taste."
"The vintage was a good one for Gallo Chardonnays, and with this bottling, held back for more than three years, they have another winner. Dry and crisp, this pineapple- and green apple-flavored wine has an earthiness suggesting sweet tobacco and fresh herbs."
"At three-plus years, this Chard tastes soft and candied, with pineapple LifeSaver flavors."
"Oak dominates, with a powerful taste of caramel and char flattening the underlying fruit. The basic wine seems to be pretty good, with crisp acidity and mineral and pineapple flavors. But all that oak is heavy-handed and unnecessary."
"The label says Napa Valley but the grapes come from Carneros, and you can taste the cool fog in the crisp acidity that frames long hangtime flavors of ripe pineapple, guava, nectarine, roasted peach and lime custard. This is a pretty Chard, balanced and dry, and it impresses for its volume and length."
"At the age of four years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit character and picking up rich, complex aged notes of glazed cashews, baked pineapple and dried peaches and apricots. It's also very spicy. Really fascinates the palate, offering a different experience each second, and should continue to interest for several more years."
"This shows what extended aging can do for a vintage sparkling wine, as it gives off delicate, ripe, mellow aromas like toasted baguette, honey, toasted almonds, white tea and apple cider. The mouthfeel is elegant and smooth, while the bubbles are soft and slow. Enjoy this before or after dinner now; it's at its aging peak."
"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%."
"A nice, crisp Chard that has pineapple, peach, pear and caramel-vanilla flavors that turn honeyed and spicy on the finish. From the Sonoma producer Ty Caton."
"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines."
"Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure."
"Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay. It has pleasant pineapple, peach and lemon flavors and crisp acidity, and while it's not especially complex, it's a nice Chard for drinking now."
"Fans of superfruity, oaky, big Chards will love this one. The grapes came from outside the true Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, but the wine shows similar power, with incredibly ripe, jammy yellow tropical fruit flavors accompanied by rich acidity. There's also a lot of new, smoky oak."
"There's something tight and minerally and acidic about this Chardonnay that will appeal to connoisseurs of austere wines. Even though the oak is nearly one-half new, the wine has a lean, lemony taste, with nuances of crème brûlée and roasted hazelnuts. Defines food-friendly elegance, and could develop bottle complexity over the next 5 years."
"Proper rather than exciting, this Chard was made classic style, with 100% barrel fermentation, 100% malolactic fermentation and plenty of lees. It's creamy and smooth, with modest flavors of peaches, pineapples and green apples."
"It has very crisp acids and those kiwi and lime flavors that mark cool-climate Chards. Oak and lees aging add richer, creamier notes."
"Captures the essence of Russian River Chard with its crisp acids that boost and brighten an explosion of taste. The tropical fruit and spice flavors are enriched by toasty oak, while sur lie aging adds a creaminess to the texture of this deliciously dry wine."
"Vegetal and watery, a very dry wine that offers little in the way of fruit. Tastes like alcohol with a drop or two of grapefruit juice."
"This high-acid Chardonnay has a prickly mouthfeel. It tastes considerably more tart than almost anything out there, which at least makes it different. Other than that, it offers fairly standard flavors of peaches, citrus fruits and pears, with oak elaborations."
"An acidic, minerally Chardonnay  showing structure, cleanliness and elegance. Richness comes by way of intense limes, as well as the usual complexities of new oak and lees aging, and there is not the slightest suggestion of sweetness. This is a very pure, Zen-like expression of cool-climate California Chardonnay."
"Oak stars in this wine, to its detriment. Underneath all that wood is a crisply elegant Chardonnay with ripe pear, peach and papaya flavors. But the oak plasters it with a ton of caramel and butterscotch that tastes excessive."
"There's a ton of oak on this wine. It dominates the underlying fruit flavors, which are actually quite pleasant, offering ripe tropical fruit and pear flavors. But the caramelized, charred wood taste dominates, resulting in an unbalanced Chardonnay."
"Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine. It's equal parts ripe green pears, Meyer lemons and smoky oak, with a firm, steely underpinning of minerals. Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle."
"This is a very low-production, best-of-barrels selection by the winemaker. It's an extremely tight young wine, austere and almost searing in acidity, with a yeasty taste from sur lies aging. If you're looking for opulent, immediately accessible Chardonnay, this isn't for you. But the wine has tantalizing hints of grilled pineapples and nectarines, and the powerful structure suggests cellaring. Stash this away for a couple of years."
"Pretty simple, but gets the job done with a creamy texture and peach and oak flavors."
"Sparkling wine specialist Scharffenberger turns its hand to Chardonnay with interesting results. Acidity is the most notable feature, higher or at least more pronounced than in most California Chards. There's also a mineral undergirding to the lemon preserves and orange zest flavors. This is one of those Chards that will likely take to aging."
"Steely, crisp and very dry, this Chard has a savory mineral underpinning to the lime, Meyer lemon, green apple and pear flavors. Shows real style and finesse through the long finish."
"Tastes way too oaky, with a plaster of sweet vanilla and caramelized charcoal. The underlying pineapple fruit just isn't strong enough to support all that wood."
"There have been Estate Selection Chards from Cuvaison before, but never a block bottling. This wine fully merits its status and price. Tightly angular and acidic in youth, it's very minerally, with a gunmetal tang to the oak-infused Meyer lemon, green apple and green pear flavors. One of the rare California Chardonnays not ready on release, this Chablis-style wine will be best in mid-2008, and should develop for another few years."
"The winery's reserve Chard has consistently been the best among their five Chards. The '05 is a dramatic wine, although oak-o-phobes might find it toothpicky. It is smoky and buttery and caramelly, but a year or so should knit that together with the ripe tropical fruits and make the wine seamlessly complex."
"Lees and new oak seem to prevail in this wine, giving it a yeasty, caramelized taste that overpowers the fruit, which seems just fine in pineapples, peaches and limes."
"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper."
"This is a single-vineyard Chard grown on Westside Road, in the heart of the northern valley's Pinot country. It's a very elaborated wine, high in acidity, showing tiers of tart green apple, Kaffir lime, pear, smoky oak, and Champagne-like lees and brioche flavors. Just great, and should hold for six years or more."
"A Brilliant Chardonnay, picked relatively early compared to some, but that has kept the alcohol moderate and the acidity brisk, making the wine crisp and even flinty. The flavors veer toward green apples, Asian pears, Meyer lemons, limes and other juicy, acid-inspired fruits."
"This five-vineyard blend of Chard has superripe, possibly botrytised, flavors of apricots and new oak. It's almost late-harvest in style, although it's fully dry. A disappointment."
"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food."
"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging. Dry and savory, it shows a strong mineral component to the pie filling limes, lemondrop, apple, fig and roasted hazelnut flavors. Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years."
"Here's one of those rare California Chards that needs time. The wine is tight, tough and minerally in its youth, with an austerity of flavors suggesting Meyer lemons, nectarines and flint. Bone dry and crisp, it should blossom between 2008 and 2015, with proper cellaring."
"Nice everyday wine, with pleasant peach, pineapple and pear flavors that finish with a touch of smoky oak and vanilla. It's easy to enjoy this one with ham, crab, corn on the cob or just by itself."
"Lots of richness in this dry, minerally Chardonnay. It has forward flavors of peaches, pears, baked green apples and flint, while lots of new oak contributes honey and caramel notes."
"This very expensive release is one of the rare examples of Chardonnay that absolutely requires bottle age. Dry and leesy now, with a mineral compactness, it shows a rich core of baked peach, spiced apple, butterscotch and smoky honey. As it warms in the glass, it develops great flavor and textural complexities. Should come into its own by 2009, and improve for many years after."
"An  everyday Chard, with superripe pear and apricot flavors and a thick coat of smoky oak."
"The vineyard is owned by the Farrells, and is located in the Green Valley, the coolest section of Russian River. The wine is very bright in acidity and clean and clear in minerals, with notes of tart lemondrop, brioche and Asian pear. Lees add a distinct taste of yeast and a rich, creamy texture. Perfect with cracked crab."
"Superripe in fruit and superoaky, this is a big, lush, powerful Chardonnay, but for all the size, it maintains balance and elegance. Potent in smoky, vanilla-accented pineapple brûlée, exotic date and stony mineral flavors, it shows the crisp acidity the vineyard is known for, and finishes dry and spicy."
"Fogarty's basic '05 Chard shows an exciting crispness and minerality that, good as it is, makes you long for the single-vineyard bottlings to come. There's an elegant angularity to the wine despite the succulent pineapples, kiwis and new oak, and a brisk acidity that makes it finish vibrantly clean."
"Dry and crisp and with some complexity. The oak is 50% new and very evident in the smoky caramel, while the fruit veers toward peaches and pineapples. As is often the case with Napa Chard, there's a sweet, herbal quality. Drink now through 2009."
"Patz & Hall has captured the cool-climate essence of southern Sonoma Chard with this dry, crisply acidic, and vibrantly fruity young wine. Might have benefitted from less new oak though, because the caramel and toast seem a little excessive."
"Made from the estate vineyard high up on Mount Veeder, the wine has a brilliant intensity and near-perfect balance. It's big, but not in the usual California style. Rather, it maintains an elegantly supple and wonderfully balanced character. The taste is of mineral-inspired tropical fruits, complexed with Burgundian technique."
"Sourced from three great Chardonnay vineyards (Stanly Ranch, Hyde and Silverado-Suscol), this Chard is enormously flavorful in fruit custard flavors and new oak. It's delicious, but a little obvious, especially on the oak side, and could have more complex nuances and angles. Drink now."
"The underlying wine is fine, with brisk, cool-climate acidity framing peach, pear and pineapple flavors. But the oak layering tastes weird and unnatural, almost sweetly medicinal, which drags down the score."
"A little weedy, despite lots of flashy oak. The pineapples and peaches have notes of dried dill and thyme, and the finish is dry and crisp. Nice with broiled halibut in a thyme-butter sauce."
"Big and bold, a Chard that shows off its terroir in the crisp, citrusy acidity and clean purity of fruit. The flavors veer toward pineapples and green tropical fruits. Oak plays a very prominent role, perhaps a little too much so, in this dry wine."
"Lots of oak on this fresh, young Chard. It's a bit too heavy on the char, toast, vanilla, and woodsap, and not enough about the peaches, pears and pineapples."
"Lush enough to drink now, with decanting, but this powerfully ripe Chard will benefit from limited aging. It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality. Give it until mid-2008, and for a couple years after."
"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit."
"From giant Brown-Forman, it's a lip-smackingly fruity Chard, bigtime in pineapple, vanilla and smoky caramel flavors, with a sweet, honeyed finish."
"A little on the sweet, jammy side, but shows plenty of Chard character, with a rich vein of creamy, smoky oak. Peaches, pears, pineapples and green apples are the flavors."
"Too oaky, with vanilla, smoky toothpick influences leading to sweet-and-sour pineapple flavors. This problem has plagued Kunde's reserve Chard for the last several vintages."
"Shafer's '05 is drier, crisper and more minerally than its predecessors from warmer vintages. You might even call it leaner. But it still shows the elegant balance that always characterizes the wine, with brilliant acidity."
"Franciscan helped pioneer the use of wild or indigenous yeasts years ago, hence the name, and whether that technique makes better wines is debatable. Still, the level of Cuvée Sauvage has been generally high. The '05 reflects the cool balance of the vintage, with ripe peach, pear, mango and oaky-butterscotch flavors accompanied by crisp balancing acidity."
"Simple and too oaky, with peach, pineapple, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors. The toast overwhelms everything."
"Here's a polished Chard with an elegant balance to a variety that often lacks both. Everything is here, from the ripe tropical fruit and rich oak to the crisp acidity and mineral trimmings, all poised in perfect equilibrium."
"This is a polished, really likeable Chard. It offers everything the variety should: a rich, creamy texture, brisk acidity, and ripe, delicious flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and kiwis coated with vanilla."
"This is the winery's big, barrel-fermented Chard. Even under all that creamy, smoky oak and leesy richness, those Edna Valley acids shine through, making the lime, kiwi and pineapple flavors bright, and leading to a zingy, crisp finish."
"This is too oaky. The wine is just overwhelmed by charry toast and strong, spicy oak wood flavors. Some people confuse the taste of Chardonnay with the taste of oak, but they are not the same."
"Something went south on this wine. It smells and tastes burnt, like it went through a fire, and the simple flavors are like the syrup in canned peaches."
"Just what many people like, an oaky, ripe, sweet Chardonnay, but purists will find it simple and pandering to public taste."
"You can really taste that cool-climate Anderson Valley acidity. There's also a minerality to the citrus and sweet oak flavors. Finishes a little austere, but elegant. Drink now."
"Rich and satisfying, this opulent Chardonnay dazzles with sheer deliciousness. Master winemaker Richard Arrowood has pulled out all the stops on this Burgundian-style wine. The flavors, of pineapple custard, lemon meringue, green apple butter, crème brûlée and gingersnap cookie, are balanced by perfect acidity. This is by far Arrowood's greatest Chardonnay in recent memory."
"New oak seems to dominate this Chard, swamping the actual flavor of the wine. The grapes provide lovely apricots and pineapples, balanced with fine acidity, but the oak swamps with smoke and vanilla and sappy wood cream."
"This is a big wine, and not really showing its best now. It's raw-boned. The oak is all smoky and spicy and dominant; the fruit is massive in pears, crunchy apples and pineapples; the acidity on the finish is tart. It needs a year or so to knit together."
"This big Chardonnay, which was entirely barrel fermented, is tasting a bit too oaky. It was sourced from the winery's estate Carneros vineyard and shows that appellation's crisp acids, along with bright tropical fruit and spice flavors. But the sweet, charry vanilla and caramel from barrels tends to dominate."
"Polished and sophisticated, with lush green apple, pineapple, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors. Likeable for its balance and sheer drinkability."
"This cold-climate vineyard is source to some of the most powerful Chardonnays in California. The '05 shows the massive tropical mango, guava, nectarine, apricot and pineapple flavors the vineyard effortlessly delivers. Almost over the top, it's saved by very crisp acidity."
"Mer Soleil Chards seem to get bigger, riper and oakier every year. Of course, this is the winery's style, and when it works, the results can be fabulously rich, but this caramelized wine seems a little top-heavy."
"Nutty and custardy, this is a full-bodied Chardonnay that emphasizes Chardonnay's textural richness when augmented by barrel fermentation and lees stirring. Toasted hazelnuts are balanced by hints of citrus. Drink now."
"This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you."
"A nice, dry Chard, a bit on the earthy, tobaccoey side, with pleasantly acidic mineral flavors and hints of lemons, limes and pineapples."
"Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish."
"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class."
"Sharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste. High acidity makes the finish searing."
"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches."
"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity."
"Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel. It's the opposite of the modern style of oaky fruit bomb Chards, with an elegant integrity that's food-friendly and ageworthy. Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade."
"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety."
"Succulent and opulent, with ripe pineapple purée, Meyer lemon tart, kiwi fruit, pastry crust and tangy mineral flavors, enriched with the buttered toast and caramel of new oak."
"This nice drinking Chard offers plenty of bang for the buck. It's dry and creamy, with oak-infused pear, peach and green apple fruit flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices."
"Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin."
"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse. Not for fruit-forward fans, its pineapple, pear and herb flavors are drying out, leading to interesting, old-wine, honey-and-cashew nuances. Drink right away, before it dies."
"Way too oaky. Compromised by the clumsy, heavy application of wood. The caramel and roasted butterscotch aromas and flavors completely swamp whatever wine lies beneath."
"Fruity and oaky, with pineapple cream, tangerine sorbet and buttered toast flavors. Made in a ripe, opulent California style."
"Here's a straightforward Chardonnay, with potent fruit and the crisp acidity of this cool, coastal region. The flavors are pure Meyer lemon, lime zest and tangy mineral."
"Very tight now, with minerally, yeasty flavors of lees and unintegrated smoky new oak. High acidity adds to the impression of austerity. Difficult to appreciate in its infancy, but this elegant, layered, complex Chard should begin to blossom after 2008 and hold for several years."
"The dryness and minerality of this wine, combined with its clean, brisk elegance, make it a very nice partner for shellfish. The flavors are lemons, limes, and ripe, crisp white peaches."
"Pessagno has a perfect track record with this cool-climate vineyard, consisently producing Chards of this caliber. The wine is tight in acids and flinty minerals, even showing new oaky tannins. But the exotic nuances of roasted peaches and grilled pineapples suggest cellarability. Best after 2008."
"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it. Acidity and ripeness are the stars, with bright, explosive flavors of pineapples, pears, Meyer lemons, limes and kiwi fruits. The smoky, spicy oak is perfectly integrated into this delightful wine."
"Oak stands out, making smoky caramel and butterscotch the dominant flavors in this Chardonnay. Below that are fruity flavors of pineapples, green apple jam and peach preserves, finished with awesome Asian spices. Just 90 cases produced."
"Ripe and oaky, with luscious flavors of pineapples, green apple butter, buttered toast and caramel, undergirded by a stony minerality. Drink now."
"A richly fruity, tropical-fruit-scented Chardonnay that offers plenty of weight and fruit at a reasonable tariff. Bits of butter, dried spices and citrus accent the ripe fruit, which finishes dry and crisp."
"Dry and crisp, with peach and citrus flavors and a touch of oak, this wine benefitted from a cool growing season in usually hot Paso Robles. It has the acidity of a true coastal white wine."
"Structure, minerals and lees mark this elegant Chardonnay. You'll find ripe pear and tropical fruits that taste like they were baked into a pie, but ripe fruit is easy to achieve these days. It's the architectural integrity that makes this wine so fine."
"If you prefer your California Chards on the minerally side instead of the flamboyant, superripe style, try this one. With its stony or metallic and citrus-inspired flavors and extreme dryness at low alcohol, it can be described as Chablisian. Hard to believe the oak is 100% new, as it doesn't taste oaky despite the streamlined profile."
"This is a classy Chardonnay. Grown 1,200 feet above Calistoga and fairly well-oaked in new barrels, it's rich and complex, with flavors of grilled tropical fruits and toasted meringue. The structure is greatly improved by a crisp, minerally edge of acidity."
"A low-priced everyday Chard of sophistication and elegance. It's dry and wonderfully crisp, with subtlely oaked flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, pears and kiwis. Easy to find, with more than 12,000 cases produced."
"Ripe and oaky, this Napa-grown Chardonnay has upfront flavors of pineapples, peaches and vanilla. The charred smokiness on the barrels stands out."
"Here's a bright, crisp young Chard. It's bone dry and vibrant in Meyer lemon, tropical fruit, spice and vanilla smoke flavors, with a keen, tangy streak of minerality. Tremendously versatile as a food wine due to its balance and finesse."
"Tastes vegetal and tired. The wine is losing its pineapple and pear fruit, and there's not much to replace it except alcohol and oak."
"This has been a consistent bottling from Wolff. The '06 shows classic Edna Valley acidity and very ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, Key limes, papayas and mangoes. It finishes with rich honey, but the wine is thoroughly dry."
"Hat Trick is the best of the best of Morgan's estate vineyard, which is in the chilliest northwestern part of the Highlands. Acidity stars, giving the wine a brilliant crispness that's so clean and fine. Barrel fermented in one-third new French oak, the wine is incredibly rich and leesy. The terroir has coaxed out complex layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, apricots and very exotic tropical fruits suggesting golden mangoes and papayas. The oak adds even richer layers of crème brûlée to this vastly enjoyable wine."
"The Australian golf legend now makes wine in California. Compared to your usual fruity Chard, this one's lean and minerally and high in acidity. But it's very clean, with tantalizing suggestions of lemon meringue and Key lime pie, and actually has a lot going for it."
"Partially barrel fermented and aged on the lees, this Chard has a creamy texture, and good flavors of pears, pineapples, figs and vanilla. Brisk acidity makes the finish clean and tart."
"This is a massive, powerful Chardonnay, a New World style that's superripe and heavily oaked. You either like it or you don't. Aficionados of this approach will love the opulence of the honey, pineapple jam, apricot, crème brûlée, vanilla and buttercream flavors. Calls for very rich dishes, like lobster."
"This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge."
"Always powerful in new oak notes and extravagantly rich in fruit and winemakers bells and whistles, this 2006 is very typical of the property. It's a food group in itself, offering tiers of pineapple crème brûlée, lemondrop, cinnamon-dusted meringue, vanilla custard and buttered toast. Drink now."
"Made in the Sleepy Hollow style, extraordinarily ripe, almost botrytized in apricot and honey flavors like a dessert wine, except that it's bone dry. Really epitomizes this vineyard and corner of Monterey, where Chard ripens to beautifully while maintaining acidity."
"A little too ripe and oaky for elegance, this is almost dessert-like, in the sweet vanilla, crème brûlée and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps to balance."
"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors."
"This is a powerful Chardonnay. It's explosive in tropical fruit, in malic acids and in new charred oak. All the parts kind of stick out on their own, going in different directions. It's a good New World style, but it should have more synergy."
"Vibrant and racy, this Chard's bright acidity boosts and brightens the lime, pineapple, Meyer lemon and vanilla flavors. Try with grilled salmon with a tropical fruit salsa topping."
"Earthy, like some Napa Chards, with a sage and thyme edge to the pear and peach fruit. The wine also is a little soft. But there's an interesting minerality. Could develop bottle complexity over the next few years."
"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume."
"Here's a rich, opulent wine. It's definitely high in acidity, which gives it a citrusy bite, but that zippiness provides a firm counterpoint to the lush tropical fruit, buttered toast and spice flavors."
"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages. It's a fine, dry, acidic Chardonnay whose oak-infused lemon and lime flavors will complement sourdough bread and cracked crab."
"The new oak stands out and dominates this Chard, and while the toasty vanilla, caramel and charred woodsap flavors are pleasant, they overpower the modest pineapple and apple fruit."
"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked. Shows a touch of bitterness in the finish, which is probably the result of its age. Still, it's a flamboyant, impressive Chardonnay, like a magnificent old tapestry that's fraying a bit around the edges."
"Very rich and honeyed, a powerhouse Chard oozing with pineapple jam, crème brûlée, and coconut candy flavors. For all its sweet mouthfeel, the wine is dry and crisp in brilliant acidity."
"Rich and ripe in fruit and a little heavy in toasty oak, this Chard will appeal to fans of that California style. It oozes with pineapple tart, peach pie, butterscotch and caramel candy flavors."
"A textbook example of a New World style of California Chardonnay, with high oak and very ripe pineapple pie filling, vanilla-honey and cinnamon spice flavors wrapped into a soft, semi-sweet mouthfeel. Many consumers will love it."
"A nice everyday Chard, fairly rich in fruit, herb and spice flavors, and with a nice overlay of oak. Easy to drink and totally dry."
"Comes down on the honeyed, easy side of Chardonnay, with ginger ale, pineapple jam, green apple butter and vanilla flavors designed to please. Drink now."
"With an over-oaked taste and sugary flavors of peach, pineapple and apricot jam, this Chard is more like a dessert wine."
"Starts with an opulent, inviting aroma of smoky honey, vanilla, tangerines, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots, green apples and minerals. In the mouth, the flavors are very similar—an explosion of fruits, spices and toast. Just a tremendous wine, but for all the volume and complexity, it's completely balanced."
"Represents a very nice value in a refreshing, balanced Chardonnay. The wine, which was aged in lots of new American oak and stirred on the lees, is rich and creamy, with citrus, mineral and yeasty flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity."
"It's all upfront in this direct Chard, with ripe pineapple, yellow apricot and passionfruit flavors that have been generously oaked. Will satisfy fans of big, lush California Chards. Drink now."
"Here's a bright, exotically fruity Chard that satisfies all around for its lime, kiwi, butterscotch, fig, honey and toast flavors and brisk, cleansing acidity. Drink this yummy wine now."
"Nothing but tons of pure Chardonnay flavor in this unoaked wine. It brims with pear, peach, pineapple, green apple, passionfruit and honey flavors that are brightened with citrusy acidity."
"Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak."
"This regional bottling has been a strong suit of Testarossa over the years, a best-barrel blend from their far-flung coastal empire of vineyards. It's very rich in apricot, pineapple, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and finishes dry and spicy. Shows an elegant complexity that should develop over the next six years."
"This is an unoaked Chardonnay, but it's so rich and forward in fruit, you may not even miss that smoky wood edge. Explodes with pineapple, peach, pear, apple, vanilla, honey and dusty spice flavors."
"High acidity and modest alcohol combine to make this dry wine crisp and elegant. It's not particularly rich, but has just enough pear and peach flavors to get by."
"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise. Shows modest peach and pear flavors, with lots of caramelly, toasty oak."
"Bright and pure, with high natural acidity framing ripe flavors of peaches, pineapples, limes, kiwi fruits and smoky, oaky vanilla. Classic Edna Valley Chardonnay."
"Frog's Leap's Chards always have a softly herbal earthiness, even though there's plenty of pineapple, green apple, apricot and vanilla oaky flavor. That herbaceousness keeps the wine from soaring."
"That terrific Santa Rita acidity is there, and the oak regimen tastes very expensive, but the fruit doesn't seem up to the task. It's a pretty good wine, with pineapples, dates, crème brûlée and spices, but there should be greater richness and complexity from this esteemed vineyard."
"Just might be the best $25 Chard out there. Gorgeous and dramatic in opulence, with a creamy texture, and tremendous in ripe tropical fruit, smoky oak and vanilla flavors. There's a long, honeyed, buttercreamy finish."
"Dry and crisp, this Chard has flavors of green apples, peaches, yellow apricots and vanilla cream, with little if any oak influence. Acidity perks it up, making the wine clean and vibrant."
"A controversial wine due to its amazing power. It's just tremendous in apricot, peach, nectarine, marzipan and crème brûlée flavors, like some dainty from a great pastry chef. But this oversized quality makes it difficult to enjoy with food. Almost better on its own as a cocktail sipper."
"This is a very rich Chardonnay, bursting with Key lime pie, ripe golden kiwi, pineapple, buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors. That fine, crisp coastal acidity makes it brisk and clean. Drink now."
"Very oaky, with sweet caramel and butterscotch flavors overshadowing the underlying pineapples, pears and limes. But crisp acidity makes for balance, and a firm, stony minerality uplifts and provides structure."
"Made in a spare, angular style, this has citrus zest, mineral and pear flavors, brightened by acidity. It's an elegant wine with a creamy, buttery texture."
"Firm and minerally, with zippy acids framing oak-touched mango, pear and sautéed banana flavors. Not a big Chard, but an elegant, crisply dry one."
"Very ripe and oaky, what this wine may lack in subtlety it makes up for in sheer power. Bursts with ripe, candied pineapple and lemon honey flavors that finish sweet."
"Soft, flat and simple, this Chard tastes like tangerine-flavored cola soda, with some oaky substance added for vanilla."
"Oaky influences give this wine a candied taste of caramel and lime pie, on top of the grapier flavors of pineapples and pears. It's solidly in the mode of what Americans want in a Chardonnay."
"Sonoma Chard costing far more, this one showed off really well. Not as powerful in fruit, but dry and smooth, with delightful pineapple, crème brûlée, peaches and cream, and caramelized oak aromas and flavors."
"Almost a repeat of the ‘05, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding."
"A nice Russian River Chard, firm in acidic minerals, with an edge of dried herbs and wood char to the pineapple, green apple and cream caramel flavors."
"Oak plays a prominent role in this Chard, giving it a wealth of sweet vanilla custard, butterscotch, toast and caramelized aromas and flavors. Under that coat is a ripe wine packed with pineapples and Meyer lemons. Drink this flamboyant wine now."
"This is a fancy Chardonnay. It impresses for the ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors that are generously oaked, and for the crisp coastal acidity that provides balance. The overall impression is of pineapple-infused crème brûlée. Drink now."
"This Chardonnay has all the highlights of Central Coast white wines. It's dry, acidic, pure and clean in varietal character, which in this case means pineapples, golden mangoes and white peaches. There's something so vanilla rich, you'd swear there was new oak, but there isn't. This is an entirely unwooded wine."
"Lockwood's lost a lot of steam over the years. This '06 Chard is thin and watery, with just a squirt of lemon and lime flavor."
"Dry and crisp in acidity, but a little tired, even though it's less than three years of age. Shows dried fruit and tobacco flavors that are turning mushroomy."
"Shows the crisp acidity that usually marks Carneros Chards, and also an earthy, freshly picked herb quality to the jammy peach, pineapple and green apple flavors. Consider it a food-worthy Chardonnay. Drink now."
"What a nice wine for this price. It's so dry and crisp and minerally and easy to drink, with enough sophistication to satisfy even fussy wine snobs. The subtle flavors include lemons, limes and smoky oak."
"Simple, oaky and fruity, with pineapple jam, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Made in a direct, consumer-appealing style."
"Very rich, very flamboyant, a Chardonnay that rocks your palate with flavor, yet has the acidic structure and dryness to keep it from going over the top. Pure Bien Nacido in the wealth of tropical fruit and spice flavors, so nicely balanced with a deft touch of oak. It represents a step above the '05 and is a wine to watch."
"There's too much oak on this wine, and the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support it. The result tastes like toothpicks, with modest flavors beneath of tangerines and pears."
"Simple, sweet and oaky, this Chard has ripe flavors of tropical fruits, pears, lemon tarts and vanilla. It's fine for big parties where Chard is in demand."
"The winery calls this unoaked Chardonnay “Homage to Chablis,” presumably because it's a high-acid, low alcohol wine whose main flavors are of minerals, with subtle elements of citrus zest and pear. It's a connoisseurs' wine that requires some understanding to appreciate. Sommeliers will love it, but it's hard to find. Only 120 cases produced."
"This is a blend of several vineyards from throughout the sprawling Sonoma Coast region. It shows crisp, upfront acidity that makes the wine tart, and lasts through the dry finish. Flavor-wise, it's all about pears, enriched with toasty oak."
"Tastes like fruity soda pop or canned fruit syrup, with sugary pineapple and pear flavors. The oak is unnaturally sweet and strong."
"An awkward Chard that tastes unnaturally oaky, with medicinal flavors of toasted, sweet vanilla bean. You'll find hints of pineapples and papayas, but that oaky thing is really strong."
"A nice followup to the winery's 2005, the '06 shows similar richness at the same price. It's expressive in ripe pineapple, peach jam and honey flavors, with buttered toast and smoky oak overtones."
"This is a lively, bright young white wine that brims with acid-inspired tangerine, lime, quince and clove flavors. It has a little touch of oak, but is really fruit-driven. Represents a nice value in a dry, fairly complex sipper."
"This powerfully ripe, direct Chardonnay shows massive flavors of pineapples, nectarines, green apples, vanilla and oaky buttered toast, brightened with crisp, coastal acidity. Nice with scallops in a saffron and coconut cream sauce."
"Those familiar with Morgan's more expensive Chardonnays, such as the Double L (which comprises 55% of this blend) will find true value in this regional wine. It shows similar power and authority in a showy, Chablis-style wine whose acidic, minerally structure frames intense citrus and oak flavors."
"High in acidity, and with a tangy, minerally flourish, this Chard has ripe flavors of pineapples and papayas, enriched with smoky-sweet, vanilla-accented oak. It's a fashionable wine that will go well with rich fare, such as scallops in a cream sauce."
"Here's a ripe, juicy Chardonnay. Grown in a warm climate, it shows powerful pear jam, baked apple pie and smoky vanilla flavors, with a note of sweetened jasmine tea and a dry, spicy finish of cloves and pepper."
"Simple and superoaky, with strong flavors of vanilla and char dominating an otherwise average Chard. Under all that smoky wood you'll find a wine of modest peach, pineapple and apricot flavors."
"This shows real varietal character with spicy peaches-and-cream flavors and a nice vein of smoky oak, and a honeyed, crisp finish."
"There's too much oak interfering with this Chardonnay, which was grown just below the Santa Lucia Highlands. The underlying fruit is fine, suggesting crisply ripe nectarines and pears, but the oak buries it under a plaster of smoky caramel and butterscotch."
"Very ripe and fruity, this is sort of a second wine from Malibu Estate, with good acidity that makes it crisp. It's an easy sipper with enough peach, pear, pineapple and spicy creamy flavors to satisfy Chard aficionados."
"An easy Chard, with good varietal character and a nice, dry finish. Crisp acids and a rich coating of oak enhance the modest pineapple, peach and pear flavors."
"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch."
"Crispness provides the balance needed for this Chardonnay. It gives a tartness to the fairly sweet, candied flavors of pineapples and butterscotch."
"Tastes like there's a great deal of residual sugar left over, giving the wine an overtly sugary sweetness that's almost like Sauternes."
"Overtly sweet, almost a dessert wine, with vanilla cream, pineapple jam and cinnamon spice flavors. Balanced by crisp, clean acidity."
"A bit soft and sweet, with a candied taste reminiscent of a pineapple and hazelnut fruit and nougat bar. The '06 Reserve is far better, though at twice the price."
"Sweet, with flavors of sugared buttercream, pineapple, vanilla and spice. If you like your Chards basically off-dry, it's for you."
"A fine Chard, richly oaked and ripely forward in tropical fruit, pear and green apple flavors wrapped into a spicy, buttercreamy mouthfeel. Really nails the California style."
"Merryvale has a terrific record with their Starmont Chard, and they haven't raised the price for many years. The ‘06 is right up there with the best of them. It's rich and creamy, filled with true Chard flavors of peaches, pears, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice."
"Talbott's style is always exotic and eccentric, with the grapes tasting so ripe, they have an almost botrytised, apricotty flavor. So it is with this '06, which also brims with grilled pineapple and sweet smoky oak. Best now."
"Dry and fashionable, this has a dusty, minerally character and high acidity that's reminiscent of a good Chablis. The cool, long vintage resulted in subtle peach, pear, pineapple and spice flavors."
"A very elaborate Chardonnay showing flavors of exotic fruits, spices, buttered toast and cream. Charred oak and acidity currently dominate, making the wine a little rigid, but a year or two in bottle should soften and sweeten."
"Simple, with apricot, peach and pineapple flavors elaborated with a coating of smoky oak. Acidity is fine, and the finish is totally dry."
"With no oak, the pure, brilliantly ripe Chardonnay fruit shines through in this rewarding wine. It's so rich in tropical fruit, peach, pear and citrus flavors, you won't even miss the barrel influence. Best of all is the cool-climate crispness that makes the finish so clean and vibrant."
"A nice Chardonnay, with enough elegance to drink with fine food. Dry and crisp, it shows mineral-infused peach, lemon and pineapple flavors that are wrapped into quite a bit of smoky oak. Drink now."
"Tastes riper and oakier than in previous vintages, giving it a somewhat flamboyant personality, but lovers of this California style will be impressed by the pineapple custard, butterscotch, crème brûlée and smoky oak flavors."
"Here's a textbook California Chardonnay made in a ripe, oaky style that pleases for its richness. The pineapple pie flavors have a toasted meringue edge, and the finish is dry and spicy."
"Crisp and flavorful, a delicious Chardonnay designed for rich fare like scallops or shrimp in saffron, coconut milk and butter sauce. The flavors of pineapples, mangoes, nectarines, peaches and smoky oak are complex and have a honey-sweet finish."
"Oaky, dry and acidic, this Chard is saved by the ripeness of the underlying fruit, which gives green apple, peach, pear and pineapple flavors. The acidity hangs in there all the way through the tart finish."
"A bit rough and scoury in texture, but otherwise this dry sparkling wine has rich, complex flavors of citrus fruits, strawberries, brioche and vanilla. Shows fine Mendocino acidity that makes it finish brisk and clean."
"Brilliant Chardonnay, compulsively drinkable. You'll find a fabulous array of flavors, ranging from pineapples, mangoes and limes to lees- and oak-influenced smoke and creamy vanilla. There's also a juicy streak of crisp acidity and a flinty tang of minerals in the finish. Very fine."
"Fruit and oak are the duo that star in this rich, forward wine. The flavors of peaches and cream, pineapple meringue pie, butterscotch, smoke and vanilla will appeal to fans of luscious California Chardonnays."
"Cultivated from a single vine many years ago that the then-vineyard manager believed was special, Husch's Vine One Chard is a soft, exotic wine. It combines smoky-sweet oak notes with baked apple, pear and quince flavors that finish dry and spicy."
"Fans of oaky Chards will find this one perfectly acceptable. It's dry and crisp, with ripe pear, peach, pineapple and smoky barrel flavors that define the California style."
"This single-vineyard wine from Foxen's estate is a little too sweet. It seems to contain residual sugar, to judge by the jellied pineapple and apricot flavors. If you don't mind that, you'll find a crisply acidic, clean wine, with oak and lees complexities."
"Has all your basic barrel-fermented Chardonnay character without being particularly complex. The wine is slightly sweet and oaky-creamy, with apricot, pineapple, peach and spicy mango flavors."
"Simple and easy, with oaky flavors of apricots, peaches and pineapples in a creamy texture. Fine for picnics and parties."
"Very ripe, almost jammy in apricots, pineapples and pears, this Chard seems sweet, like sugared or honeyed pie-filling. The finish is a bit cloying."
"Here's an everyday, country-style Chardonnay with good enough flavors of tropical fruits and smoky vanilla oak, and a nicely creamy texture, to satisfy."
"This unoaked Chardonnay is marked by quite crisp acidity, as the malolactic fermentation was prevented. It's the opposite of opulent, a flinty wine with hints of Meyer lemons and Kaffir limes. Try with shellfish."
"Tastes sweet, almost like a dessert wine. Brings to mind a tart with smoky dough, pineapple, mascarpone cheese, apricot cream and orange liqueur flavors. Exotic, and probably better as a cocktail sipper than paired with food."
"This Chardonnay is similar in flavors and texture to far more expensive bottlings, with a wealth of peaches, pears, pineapples and buttercream. For the price, it's hard to beat."
"If you like your Chards on the sugary side, this wine in a box is a pretty good buy. At the equivalent of five bucks a bottle, it has crisp flavors of peaches, pears, green apples and vanilla."
"Ripe and sweet in apricot, pear, coconut macaroon, vanilla and Asian spice flavors, this Chard benefits from crisp acidity. It's not really dry, but has many interesting tastes."
"Racy and pure, this Chard shows the bright lime, lemon and kiwi flavors of Edna Valley Chards, with a sleek undergirding of steely minerals. It's crisp and dry, although smoky oak lends caramel and vanilla notes."
"Over the years Mondavi's Reserve has taken a turn toward Chablis. Fans of lush, superripe Chards will find it tart, but it's really balanced and elegant. With a dry tang of minerals, it shows bright Meyer lemon, lime, pineapple and white peach flavors. One-third new oak adds creamy, smoky vanilla complexities. Should develop over the next six years."
"Far too much sugary sweetness mars this Chardonnay. The peach, pear and tropical fruit flavors are well-oaked, adding caramel candy to the jelly flavors."
"Tastes sugared, and the fruit is thin, making the alcohol taste hot."
"A very nice Chardonnay that defines the modern, ripe style, Beringer's '06 is rich in pineapple, green apple, grilled peach and smoky new oak flavors. The honeyed taste is balanced with vital acidity that makes the wine finish clean."
"A lovely Chardonnay to drink tonight, this one, from the winery's fine Carneros vineyard on the Napa side, shows bright, mineral-infused pineapple, lime and spicy clove and pepper flavors. The acidity will balance a rich dish, such as seared scallops in a coconut-curry sauce."
"Richly oaked, fantastically ripe in long hangtime fruit, this Chard has exotic flavors of golden mangoes, nectarines, passionfruit, pineapple jam and kiwis. Oak adds extra layers of buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky vanilla. For all the honeyed sweetness, it's totally dry, a tour de force that's at its best now."
"Iron Horse's estate Chard is a remarkably consistent wine. Never overoaked, superripe or heavy, it always has an elegant minerality. The '06, from a coolish vintage, is flavored with green apples, Meyer lemons and Bosc pears."
"Drier and leaner than the 2005, this is a fancy Chardonnay marked by crisp structure and minerality, rather than extreme lushness. Yet you'll find an overlay of toasty oak and fine flavors of green apples and pineapples that satisfy the fruit tooth. The alcohol is under 14%, and the finish is totally dry."
"Jordan's Chardonnay was made full-Burgundian style, barrel-fermented in nearly half new oak and aged on the lees. Partial malolactic fermentation has enabled brisk, appley acidity to remain. The flavors are of green apples and nectarines, with a mineral tug. This is an elegant, sophisticated Chardonnay."
"Bright in acidity, and powerful in flavor, this Chard oozes ripe pineapple, green apple, mineral, honeysuckle and spicy flavors. Totally dry, it's a little tight, and could develop some bottle complexity in a few years. Nice with Asian fare."
"Very rich in oak and ripe fruit, with kiwi, lime, pineapple and fig flavors that finish crisp and dry. The oak really stands out with its blast of buttered toast, caramel and woodspice."
"Here's an elegant, crisp Chardonnay marked by the smoke and wood tannins of oak. The underlying wine has flavors of green apples and nectarines. It's bone dry and sleek, a wine made to accompany food, not overwhelm it."
"Lots of acidity and steel in this bone-dry Chard. Also, pronounced toasty oak, with a butterscotch and caramel taste dominating. Fortunately there's a good underpinning of peach, pear and pineapple fruit."
"A good followup to last year's bottling, Cobblestone's '06 Chard hails from the Arroyo Seco, known for crisp, ripe, elegant white wines. It brims with pineapple, peach, tangerine, mineral, buttered toast and vanilla spice flavors."
"Very dry and quite acidic, this racy Chardonnay has a Chablis-like minerality that suggests chalk and steel. That may come from the grapes that were grown in the far southerly part of the valley. An equal percentage hails from warmer St. Helena, and they seem to have contributed the pears and peaches."
"A good, everyday Chardonnay that gets the job done with proper peach and pear flavors, overlaid with oak and wrapped into a creamy texture."
"Oak dominates this Chard. It's an example of the old criticism, drinking toothpicks. The flavors of buttered toast, caramel, roasted meringue and crème brûlée dominate the pineapple and pear fruit, unbalancing an otherwise excellent wine."
"Tastes too oaky and extracted, making the sweet wood, butterscotch, pear jam, peach cobbler and pineapple custard flavors a little obvious. But it will satisfy fans of this style."
"Tastes a bit sharp and minty in the mouth, but you'll find some good new oaky vanilla and smoke flavors backing up pineapples, green apples and pears."
"Straightforward, this Chard shows well-ripened flavors of pineapple jam, nectarines, peaches and vanilla. It finishes with caramelized, butterscotchy sweetness."
"Pretty good, with ripe pineapple flavors brightened with crisp acidity. But the oak is too strong, coating the fruit with a heavy plaster of butterscotch and smoky caramel."
"Rich in pineapple custard, pear and mineral flavors, this Chard offers lots of direct pleasure. Drink now with crab cakes, roast salmon, or squash risotto."
"Very forward and mouth-filling in pineapples, mangoes, nectarines, guavas and figs. Yet the wine is dry and crisp. Shows flamboyance rather than complexity, and will appeal to fans of this hedonistic style."
"Very weak, with watery fruit and medicinal oak flavors. Not offering much, even at this everyday price."
"Simple, soft, and slightly sweet, with the flavors of canned peaches, pears and apricots."
"New oak accounts for about one-third of this wine, but the wood really stands out. The underlying wine is rather dry, lean and citrusy. It's eleganty structured, not an opulent palate seducer but a companionable wine for food."
"A fine Chardonnay, marked by crisp, citrusy acidity that cleanses the mouth and makes the wine so refreshing. Flavorwise, it's a powerhouse, with pear, green apple, lemon meringue, buttered toast and smoky, vanilla flavors that finish in a swirl of cloves and pepper."
"The vineyard is in the cool, southwesterly Green Valley, and the wine shows brilliant acidity and tangy green apple flavors, enriched with spicy, smoky new oak. It's a forward, rather pushy Chardonnay, insistent in its New World assertiveness, but an enormously attractive one that calls for equally big foods, like lobster, or scallops in a coconut-curry sauce."
"Up there in the Chalone hills they have a lot of limestone, and you can taste the flint and chalk in this wine even through the lavish tropical fruit and spice. It's a really interesting Chardonnay that's quite fancy and elegantly structured, and it will hold for a good six years."
"A very fine Chardonnay notable for its concentration, power and elegance. Framed in well-oaked flavors of smoky vanilla and honey, the underlying fruit is very ripe in peaches, pears and figs, balanced with racy acidity. Delicious now, and should hold for five years or so."
"Shows that distinctive Edna Valley acidity and pure, laser-like Meyer lemon and lime fruit, while new oak and considerable sur lie aging adds richer notes of cream and yeast. Drink now for its vibrant youthfulness."
"They used wild yeasts to ferment this Chard, and there is something exotic and feral about the flavors, which go beyond nectarines and pears into fruits without names. It's missing some crispness, but shows richness and opulence."
"This is a richly oaked young Chardonnay. It brims with ripe papaya, mango, pineapple and apple flavors, while the oak barrels add layers of buttered toast, honey and vanilla meringue."
"A modestly flavored Chard, marked by dryness and acidity that make the mouth water, with a touch of green apple and nectarine fruit. Really needs food to enrich it."
"Tastes like there's too much oak on this Chard. Although the new wood is only 20%, the wine oozes sweet, caramelized vanilla, with only modest expressions of fruit. The underlying wine just isn't powerful enough to support that powerhouse overlay."
"Made in an appealing popular style, this Chard has ripe flavors of pineapples, pears, peaches and figs, with oak barrel notes of creamy vanilla and smoke."
"Here's a rich Chardonnay. It's upfront in pineapple pie, peach cobbler, pear jam, apple butter and caramelly oak flavors, yet is dry and pleasantly crisp in acidity. Drink now."
"Too sweet, with a sugary finish that tastes like lemonade and pineapple juice."
"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes. It's also a very crisp wine, as it did not undergo the malolactic fermentation."
"This is rich and fruity and direct. It appeals for its acid-laced lime, kiwi, passionfruit and pineapple flavors and rich, smoky coat of oak."
"With forward pineapple jam, apricot, buttered toast, vanilla and smoky oak flavors, this will satisfy Chard lovers. It's dry, with a creamy mouthfeel."
"A very nice Chard that, at seven bucks less than the winery's Premier Reserve, is nearly as good. Dry and crisp in acidity, it has rich honey, pineapple and smoke flavors. How can a wine taste like honey and be dry? It's called magic."
"Here's a basic, Santa Barbara Chardonnay that shows off the region's cool-climate friendliness to the variety. It's dry and crisp and creamy, with pineapple, lime and oak flavors."
"Soft and gluey, with sweet, jammy flavors of pineapples and butterscotch. Tastes like cough drops."
"A nice Chardonnay that feels pedigreed and well-made, with crisp acidity and a creamy texture framing very ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors. The oak dominates, however, making the wine heavy in sweet, caramelized toast."
"Serious white wine. Dense and full-bodied, it's incredibly lush in tropical fruit and apricot flavors. Entirely dry, it shows a honey-sweet layer that's crisp and well-balanced."
"A beautiful wine, crisp and elegant, filled with varietal complexity. Oak-inspired butterscotch and vanilla custard accent ripe fruit flavors of grilled pineapples and ripe kiwi, with a long, spicy finish. Beautiful now and for a year or two."
"Made in an immediately appealing, oaky way, this Chard has appealing peach, pear, green apple and honey flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie. Easy to find, with more than a million bottles in circulation."
"With a generous bite of acidity, this fine Chardonnay is extremely flavorful. Traditionally one of the winery's top Chards, it's explosive in pineapple, Asian pear, crème brûlée and roasted marshmallow flavors. Finishes in a swirl of creamy, buttery spices."
"This is the winery's best Chardonnay blend. It comes mainly from Sanford & Benedict Vineyard, and shows the fine structure associated with the appellation. Juicy acidity firms up the oak-inspired Meyer lemon, crushed pineapple and tangy mineral flavors. Should soften and become more complex over the next six years."
"This is a terrific wine, extremely powerful in fruity flavors. It impresses for its sheer volume. Waves of apricots, nectarines, pears, green apples, butterscotch, buttered toast and smoky, vanilla-tinged oak surf the palate, carried along on a wave of crisp acidity."
"Ripe, soft and creamy smooth, this Chard has polished flavors of pineapple jam, vanilla, pears, apple butter, honey and cinnamon."

"Showing true cool-climate character, this Chard brims with tropical fruit, pear, honeysuckle and smoky oaky-vanilla flavors, with a gentle scour of acids. Pretty good price for a wine this rich."
"Dry and flinty, with flavors of grilled pineapples, peaches, pears and roasted hazelnuts, this wine has a stony, minerally taste. Santa Lucia Highlands and Arroyo Seco fruit are well represented in this stylish wine."
"Showing a flavor concentration unusual in California Chardonnay, this mountain wine is massive in baked tropical mango, guava and peach flavors, even a decadent taste of ripe bananas sautéed in butter and spiced with cinnamon, cloves and gingersnap cookie. It's also rich in smoky, caramelized oak, yet there's a firm backbone of minerals that, together with crisp acids, gives the wine structure."
"For years Chateau Potelle has been turning out tremendous, bracing Chardonnays. The '06 VGS is an awesomely powerful wine, focused like a laser with well-oaked pineapple, passionfruit, tangerine and apricot flavors that are balanced with crisp acids. Notable for purity and strength, this Chardonnay will drink well over the next 6 years."
"This is a big, powerful Chardonnay that impresses for sheer volume. Crisp acidity provides a keen balance to the ripe pineapple, white peach custard, sweet green apple purée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors that finish with a smoky swirl of dusty spices."
"Like the 2005 vintage, this bottling has 100% new French oak. But the wine feels more balanced and fatter than its predecessor, and over all more satisfying. The mineral-infused roasted pineapple, candied ginger and crème brûlée flavors finish dry and crisp and elegant. Great job from Beringer's winemaker emeritus, Ed Sbragia."
"This is a very powerful Chardonnay, brimming in guava, golden mango, white peach, pear and Key lime pie flavors, to which smoky oak adds even richer layers of butterscotch and caramel. A crisp edge of peppery acidity provides a clean, zesty balance to this enormous wine."
"There's lots of acidity in this young wine, which gives it a slightly minty, prickly feeling that actually adds to its food-friendliness. With pineapple, green apple, spice and smoky oak flavors, it finishes thoroughly dry. Easy to find, with 30,000 case production."
"Shows a welcome return to form, with lush, oak-inspired flavors of grilled pineapples, apricots and mulled green apple cider. This is a very good price for a Chardonnay of this quality."
"Very dry, tartly acidic and lemony, almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, but with richer notes of pineapple cream. Super-drinkable, and the low alcohol won't overpower a delicate dish, like sole in a garlicky butter sauce."
"Fruity-sweet and oaky, with buttered popcorn and pineapple juice flavors."
"Just beautiful and oh, so refreshing. The cool vintage has resulted in a high-acid wine of enormous fruit, bursting with intense, classic Edna Valley flavors of limes, kiwis, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle and minerals. The vanilla spice and creamy smoke have got to come from the terroir, because the wine never saw a splinter of oak."
"It's all about acidity and long hangtime with this Chard. The acids come from chilly, foggy nights, the ripeness from long, warm, sunny days. What you get is oodles of bright, pure pineapple, Granny Smith apple, Meyer lemon and spicy clove flavor, with a touch of caramelized oak for richness."
"High, brisk acidity is the star in this Central Coast Chard. It gives a good kick to the ripe guava, nectarine, mineral and vanilla flavors. Good value, and very versatile with food."
"With no oak influences at all, this Chard is on the acidic side, with bright, clean flavors of green grapes, yellow apricots and fresh pineapples. It's dry, but rich in fruity essence."
"Creamy smooth and enlivened with brisk acidity, this Chard shows forward, tart green apple, lime and pineapple flavors. Oak barrels add even richer notes of buttered toast and butterscotch to this elegant sipper."
"Showing Talley's distinctive elegance and brilliant structure, this Chard is a blend of the Rincon and Rosemary's vineyards. The wine's architecture really makes it special, with acidity and dusty tannins providing the bare bones to the lemon, lime, pineapple and mango fruit. A great wine to have with food."
"A truly succulent, opulent Chardonnay. Tastes quite oaky with char and butterscotch flavors, but not too oaky. The barrel regimen is precisely in keeping with the ripe tropical fruit and honeysuckle flower flavors. Feels rich and dramatic."
"The oaky power of this wine is its hallmark, giving smoky, buttered toast, vanilla and woody extract tastes to the underlying pineapple and pear flavors. Would be better if the oak weren't quite so dominant."
"Tastes oaky and ripe, with smoky, butterscotchy flavors of pineapples, candied apples and pear jam. Production was 3,232 cases."
"Oaky, with dominating aromas and flavors of butterscotch, vanilla custard and meringue. Underneath all that are ripe pineapple and golden mango flavors."
"Probably the most expensive unoaked Chard out there, this is a stunning wine, showing the laserlike purity and bright acids that this northwestern part of the Highlands coaxes from the grapes. The brilliantly illuminated flavors range from limes and kiwis to green apples, peaches and guavas. The finish is dry, but with a honeyed unctuousness that could be a touch of botrytis."
"This is a very dense, layered wine, with many intricate corners to explore. The winemaker has put on lots of lees and quite a bit of new oak, which of course adds creamy, smoky complexities. Fortunately, the underlying wine can handle it. Pure Santa Lucia Chardonnay, it's intricate in tangerines, limes, pineapples, honeysuckle and Asian spices, with a flinty minerality. Acidity is quite high."
"ZD's reserve Chard is from Napa Valley. This California bottling is from Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and Santa Barbara. It's very ripe, with upfront pineapple jam, vanilla cream and butterscotch flavors. A crisp streak of cool-climate acidity permeates throughout."
"Year after year, Bonterra crafts splendidly pure varietal wines, from organically-grown grapes, and in large quantities that make them easy to find. The '06 Chard is delicious in pineapple, sweet Meyer lemon, tangerine, lime and caramelized vanilla oak flavors that finish clean and long. What a super value."
"A rich, direct Chard that leaves little to the imagination. It offers a sunburst of oak-inspired tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe and jammy, in the modern California style."
"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard."
"A bit unrefined, with candied pear, apricot jam and oak flavors and a soft texture. Feels heavy, instead of lively."
"Rich doesn't begin to describe this Chard. It's humongous in pie-filling and grilled peaches, pears, pineapples and papayas, while 50% new oak adds all sorts of buttercream, crème brûlée and smoked butter layers. Yet the wine shows a minerality that grounds and balances it. Very fancy stuff, and should age for up to six years."
"This is the winery's bells and whistles Chardonnay. Grown from inland fruit, in a vineyard near Ukiah, it's rich in buttercreamy peach, pear and pineapple flavors, with a spicy, racy finish."
"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent."
"This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now."
"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture."
"Ripe and oaky. May fall a bit short on complexity and finesse, but makes up for it in sheer power. Pineapple crème brûlée, spicy green apple butter, ripe pear, Asian spices and smoky oak are the flavors, backed with firm acidity."
"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance."
"Quite a good Chardonnay for the price. Shows classic flavors of pineapples, pears and apples, enriched with smoky oak and vanilla, and folded into a creamy texture. Good value, and easy to find, with 7,800 cases produced."
"Plenty of smoky, spicy oak on this Chard, along with ripe, orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. It's a little rough around the edges, though. Drink now."
"With its vanilla buttercream and spicy, smoky overtones, this Chard also shows underlying fruit flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and green apples. It's a crisp, supple young wine, and this is a good price to pay."
"Sweet and direct, with honeyed flavors of pineapples, buttered popcorn, vanilla and cinnamon. Will satisfy fans of this ripe, oaky style."
"A pretty good Chardonnay. Its a little pineapple juicy, and the oak is pretty strong, but a streak of minerality and crisp, clean acidity give just enough structure."
"Monterey's cool-climate flavors of lemons and limes marry richer, more tropical Santa Barbara notes in this creamy smooth Chardonnay. Oak plays a prominent role, lending an edge of vanilla and buttered toast. This is a very good price for the quality."
"Achieves the difficult feat of tasting sweet but finishing dry. The pineapple custard, peach pie and butterscotch flavors are impossible to resist, yet the wine firms up on the finish, with a scour of dry acidity."
"A very good wine that easily earns its score, but is not perfect. It's a bit on the fruity-sweet, one-dimensional side, with jammy pineapple and apricot flavors, enriched with sweet, smoky, vanilla-accented oak. Yet fine, firm coastal acidity provides needed balance."
"Shows the crisp acidity and delicately silky mouthfeel of Carneros Chard, with ripe flavors of pineapples, guavas, kiwis and minerals. Could be a tad drier, but it's a pretty nice wine."
"Here's a crisp Chardonnay that gets those tastebuds whistling with tartness. Yet it's balanced out by extremely rich fruit and oak. Pineapple crème brûlée, white peach, green apple butter, vanilla and toasty sandalwood are the flavors of this delicious, complex Chardonnay. Drink now."
"Lots of smoky oak frames modest flavors of pineapples in this creamy wine. Production was 6,300 cases."
"Smoky, sweet oak and vanilla dominate this wine, which also has flavors of mangoes, peaches and pears. The oak is simply too strong for the underlying fruit."
"Brilliantly crisp and lushly creamy and honeyed, just a beautiful Chardonnay that offers decadence and sheer deliciousness. Massive in grilled pineapples, green apples, ripe nectarines and butterscotch, brightened with mouthwatering acidity. A joy to drink."
"In the explosion of unoaked Chards lately, the Central Coast has proved itself as the go-to region. Domaine Alfred's bottling is just super, a rich, zesty wine whose acidity makes your palate dance to the music of tangerines, limes, kiwis and pineapples."
"Here's a brisk, bright and very flavorful Chardonnay for drinking with rich fare, like crab, pork, scallops or chicken in a buttery cream sauce. It's strong in acidity, with honeyed, creamy flavors of kiwi fruit, limes, pineapples and vanilla."
"This is a blend of Testarossa's far-flung vineyards across California, hence the statewide appellation. It's extraordinarily rich and explosive in apricots, pineapples, guavas, nectarines, buttered toast and smoky, caramelized oak. So muscular that you might want to age it for a year or two, to let it calm down."
"This is one of the bigger, more powerful Chardonnays out there in the market. It's triumphant in ripe pineapple jam, apricot-infused crème brûlée, Meyer lemon custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, wrapped into a creamy rich texture that finishes dry and crisp. May lack subtlety, but what immense pleasure it offers."
"Eccentric, with sweet and sour tangerine, banana and buttered toast flavors. Crisp acidity provides balance, but the wine is nearing the end of its useful period."
"A very nice Chardonnay that has the dusty, herbal tug that Napa Chards often display. Otherwise it's very rich, with potent pineapple pie and peach tart flavors, enriched with creamy lees and buttery new oak. Drink now–2012."
"Very dry, a lean, austere Chardonnay currently marked by aloof flavors of lemons, limes and oak. Yet there's something going on. As the wine warms in the glass it becomes richer, showing hidden pineapple tart, macadamia and crème brûlée. Firm, minerally acidity is there throughout, making for a mouthwatering cleanliness. Drink this streamlined, Chablis-like wine now–2013."
"Made in the modern style of ripe fruit and elaborate oak, this rich, creamy Chardonnay features pineapple jam, peach pie and toasty vanilla flavors. It's a bit obvious, but lipsmackingly delicious."
"Chardonnays from this vineyard always are powerful, but this bottling is over the top. It has ultraripe apricot and tangerine flavors, with strong acidity. Seems almost botrytised, with a honeyed intensity, although it's dry."
"This is a very flamboyant Chardonnay. The grapes are superripe in pie-filling pineapples, nectarines and oranges, enhanced with smoky oak and sweet buttered popcorn, but the finish is completely dry. Drink now with rich fare, like lobster and shellfish."
"Tastes as sweet as Lifesaver lemon and pineapple candy, with low acidity."
"This started out as a perfectly nice Chardonnay. It was dry, crisp and balanced, with a minerality under the pineapple and peach flavors. Then the winemaker decided to plaster it with oak, and it tastes like it went through the malolactic fermentation. The quality was lessened."
"This is a big, rich, showy Chardonnay. Barrel fermented and aged in 80% new French oak, it shows buttered toast and charry vanilla bean aromas and flavors. The fruit below is good, if a little heavy and ripe, suggesting apricots and pears. Best now in its youth."
"Very rich, creamy and oaky, made in the ripe, California style of Chardonnay. Brims with buttered toast, vanilla cream, and caramelized wood aromas and flavors riding over underlying pineapples, pears and limes. Flamboyant, if a little top-heavy. Ready now."
"This is a first release from the winery's estate vineyard, high atop the Mayacamas Mountains overlooking Alexander Valley. It's intense and concentrated in pineapple crème brûlée, peach purée, green apple, honeysuckle and smoky sandalwood flavors, undergirded with a firm minerality. Delicious and compelling, and should develop over the next six years."
"Lush and opulent as are Stonestreet's other Chards, with potent flavors of ripe mashed pineapples, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, vanilla and smoky sandalwood. Dramatic and compelling. The crisp acidity and tightness suggest short-term ageability. Now–2013."
"Crisp and luscious, this coastal Chardonnay shows off its cool-climate origins and fine vintage. Displays ripe pineapple tart, green apple butter and flamboyant lime flavors, enriched with sweet smoky oak, and balanced with clean, citrusy acidity."
"Acidity and minerality mark this vibrant, complex young Chardonnay. It has a tart, sour pineapple candy flavor, softened and enriched with sweet smoky oak and butterscotch, and undergirded with a chalky tang. Very fine, and will develop for 4–6 years."
"Rich in acids and steely minerals, which gives the wine a tart scour, grounding the pineapples, pears and honeyed oak. Very nice and classic, and should gradually develop bottle complexities through 2013."
"This vineyard has a long, distinguished history, even before it passed into Jackson Family's hands. It's a great mountain property, yielding focused, concentrated flavors of tropical fruits that are well oaked. There's also a firm minerality. One of the few Chards that can age. Better 2011–2013."
"Balanced and dry, this Chardonnay has pleasant flavors of green apples and pineapples, with creamy, yeasty complexities achieved through barrel fermentation and lees aging. The price is fair for the quality."
"A dry, slightly herbal Chardonnay, with oak-inspired pear, peach and pineapple flavors. Feels elegant and sophisticated. Drink now."
"Very rich in oak, with massive buttered toast, caramel and crème brûlée flavors. The underlying fruit is good, suggesting pineapples and ripe peaches, but misses a beat for all that winemaker intervention. Drink now."
"Very ripe, rich and new-oaky, with dazzling flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, limes, caramel and buttered toast, drizzled with vanilla honey. A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay of enormous power and concentration. Could use a touch more nuance and complexity, but a tremendous wine at a good price for the quality."
"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013."
"Oak and lees give rich, yeasty, butterscotchy complexities, and a creamy texture, to this fine young Chardonnay. Fortunately, the underlying varietal flavors are strong in pineapple, apple, honeydew and papaya. Only 500 cases were produced."
"Oaky and direct in ripe tropical fruit, with a gooseberry taste more akin to Sauvignon Blanc, this Chard is unripe and simple."
"With no oak, this Chard brims with the flavors of crisp green apples, ripe buttery pears, white peaches, vanilla and spice. Fully dry, it's notable for its balance and elegant integrity, and is a bracing accompaniment to shellfish."
"The oak flavoring overpowers, with smoky char, buttered toast, caramel and sweet vanilla dominating the pineapple and pear fruit."
"Tired of oaky fruit bomb Chards? This one's notable for structure. Crisp acidity and a firm streak of minerals undergird the grilled pineapple, cinnamon apple sauce and buttered toast flavors. Drink this elegant wine now."
"Very dry and kind of earthy and herbal. Shows lots of sweet vanilla and oak, but not much fruit. Maybe some pineapples. The poster child for why Napa Valley struggles with Chardonnay."
"Very Chablis-like, this coastal Chardonnay has high acidity that makes it clean and vibrant. The flavors are marked by minerals and Meyer lemons, with a touch of smoky oak. It's a fine, dry white wine that will pair well with a wide range of foods, and it's from Francis Ford Coppola."
"Shows distinct cool-climate acidity framing streamlined flavors of pineapples, lemons and limes, minerals and spices. It's an elegantly structured, clean wine that will satisfy Chardonnay lovers."
"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years."
"True to this negociant's style, this Chardonnay offers lots of bang for the buck. It delivers true varietal character, offering flavors of pineapples, pears and oak, wrapped into a creamy texture that finishes dry and spicy."
"Chardonnay fans will like the pineapple and pear flavors, with their creamy, spicy edge of vanilla and pepper spice. It's a direct, dry wine at a pretty good price."
"This is a very ripe and rather oaky Chardonnay that shows off how well the vintage perfected the grapes. Brims with smoky flavors of pineapple custard, Meyer lemon pie filling, butterscotch and cinnamon spices. Calls for rich fare, such as scallops."
"Very rich and oaky, with bigtime flavors of grilled pineapples and peaches, pears, buttered toast and oak spices. Only 250 cases produced."
"An awesome Chardonnay. Explodes in the mouth with massive pineapple, crème brûlée, apricot jam and new oak flavors that finish thoroughly dry. For all the richness, there's a near-perfect balance of acidity, and a mineral undertow that grounds the wine, providing vitality and life. Brilliant now and through 2013."
"Farrell's 2007 lineup of Chardonnays is a triumph, and this Starr Ridge is among their best. It's a big wine, rich in tropical fruit, peach, green apple, mineral and oak flavors that completely satisfy now. Yet there's an acidic urgency that suggests aging for up to six years, by which time the wine should achieve a honeyed creaminess."
"The vineyard source is in the cooler part of the valley. The wine is nicely crisp, giving a refreshingly clean mouthfeel that balances the very rich, extracted pineapples, apricots, pears, green apples and peaches. Lots of new oak adds vanilla, butterscotch and sweet cream."
"Elegant rather than powerful, this Chard has tropical fruit, apricot and oak flavors wrapped into a creamy texture. It turns sweet and spicy, like vanilla custard, on the finish."
"Ripe, fruity and oaky, in the modern style, this Chard shows vanilla and butterscotch-tinged flavors of candied pineapples and honey."
"Even though this wine is nicely dry and crisp, it's too vegetal, with a green bean taste."
"Simple and sweet in Chardonnay character, with pineapple, pear, peach, apple and vanilla flavors wrapped in a creamy texture."
"Shows good Chardonnay character in the rich texture and upfront flavors of pineapples, peaches and cream. This is a pretty decent price for the quality."
"Tastes jammy sweet and oaky, with vanilla and caramel flavors framing pineapples and peaches. Gets the Chardonnay job done at a basic level."
"Very ripe and oaky. Bursts with pineapple pie filling, tapioca, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Could use some complexity and restraint."
"Shows good Chardonnay character in the creamy texture and peach, pineapple and pear flavors. It's a little rustic, but this is a good price for what you get."
"Sweet and simple, like a blend of pineapple juice, pear juice and lemonade. But the wine is clean and crisp."
"Simple and sweet. Tastes like canned juices of pineapples, peaches and pears, with a hint of vanilla and smoke."
"A good value in a super-oaky Chardonnay, brimming with pineapple, vanilla and butterscotch flavors that finish sweet and clean."
"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill."
"A first-rate Chardonnay reminiscent of a fine French Chablis. Ultra-dry and steely, with mouthwatering acidity framing flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, lychee and minerals. Oak is there, in the background, providing hints of butter and toast."
"All the oaky, leesy richness is there, with buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky buttercream, and tons of fruity ripeness, with a blast of Meyer lemon, pineapple, white peach and apricot. Yet there's also a firm, steely minerality, and, despite the dryness, maybe even a delicious touch of botrytis. The acidity is mouthwatering."
"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth."
"The vintage was very kind to Chardonnay, and the balance shows in the fantastically ripe, exotic pineapple tart, lemondrop candy, buttered toast, sandalwood and sweet, dusty spice flavors of this immaculately dry, crisp wine. It's strong and impressive now, and not particularly subtle, but should have a narrow window of near perfection. 2011–2013."
"Good structure on this wine, with fine acidity providing clean balance. It sure is fruity, though, with massive pineapple, peach, apple and smoky oak flavors that could use a bit more finesse and subtlety."
"Very ripe and Burgundian in the wealth of flamboyant pineapples, guavas, minerals, buttered toast, crème brûlée and vanilla, wrapped into a creamy, leesy texture. A bit unfocused now, and should be best by the Fall of 2009."
"Made in the white Burgundy style, this Chardonnay features enormously ripe flavors complexed with oak and lees aging. It offers a blast of pineapple tart, pear jam, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, accented by high, crisp acidity. A blend of some of the best vineyards Pessagno accesses."
"A little heavy and syrupy, but for twelve bucks, you get a creamy wine with pineapple jam and vanilla flavors."
"The vineyard is in the interior part of the appellation, toward Carneros, and the wine displays the firm, acidic minerality of that cool, foggy region. It has fantastic limpidity. The oak is remarkable for the purity of vanilla and smoky honey, while the underlying flavors of Meyer lemons, pineapples, nectarines and kumquats are decadently good. A masterpiece of Chardonnay."
"Tastes a bit medicinal, with a sweet-sour quality of lemons and pineapples, and is quite acidic. Lacks richness, but it's a decent everyday Chardonnay."
"Tart and jammy, with acidic, one-dimensional flavors of pineapples, vanilla and butterscotch."
"A very good Chardonnay that displays admirable dryness and firmness of structure, with good fruit. Feels clean in the mouth, with a taste of cold steel that undergirds pineapple and buttered toast flavors."
"A beautiful Chardonnay that shows ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and papayas, offset with clean acidity. Shows a touch of oak. Will satisfy Chard fans, and is super food-friendly with grilled salmon, shrimp, scallops."
"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity. Showcases dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, mangoes, buttered toast, buttercream, meringue and honeysuckle, accented with dusty spices. Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow."
"About as rich and flamboyant as California Chardonnay gets, a wine that blows you away with sheer pyrotechnic wizardry. Massive in grilled pineapples, mangoes, Key lime pie, vanilla honey, crème caramel and dusty spices, accented with perfect acidity."
"If you're looking for a more acidic, balanced and minerally Chardonnay, this one's for you. It's crisp and streamlined, but doesn't compromise on flavor, offering tiers of pineapple, papaya, ripe white peach and golden nectarine, made richer with smoky oak."
"Oaky and tart, with pineapple crème brûlée, Asian pear, vanilla and buttered popcorn flavors. A good, crisp Chardonnay to drink now."
"Smooth and creamy, with mineral-infused pineapple crème brûlée, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors. Rich, if a little direct. Drink now."
"A bit on the sweet, fruity-oaky side, but saved by crisp acidity. Shows jammy pineapple, lemon, buttered popcorn and smoke flavors."
"Very rich, oaky and acidic, showing the crisp, minerally profile that usually marks white wines from this Monterey appellation. The flavors veer toward lemons, limes and Asian pears. Drink this drily elegant Chardonnay now."
"The wine brims with pineapples, Asian pears and papayas, dusted with every spice in your pantry. It's bone dry, with a crisp bite of acidity. A touch of oak and lees gives it a rich edge of cream and buttered toast."
"Shows the herbal, sweet green pea quality that often marks Chards from the central Napa Valley, but that gives it an interesting twist. Otherwise, you'll find tropical fruits, cream, buttered popcorn and zesty acidity."
"Super-rich in tropical fruit, pineapple, apricot, pear and vanilla custard flavors, this is a useful, crowd-pleasing Chardonnay at an affordable price."
"A pretty nice Chardonnay at an affordable price. Dry and crisp, it shows pleasant flavors of pineapples, pears, peaches, vanilla and buttercream."
"A decent everyday Chard, with ripe flavors of pineapples, peaches and pears, and an oaky influence of vanilla and buttercream."
"Average- quality Chardonnay, with ripe tropical fruit and spice flavors, sound acidity and a pleasantly rich coat of smoky, buttery oak. Seems pricey."
"A good, solid California Chardonnay at a fair price. It's creamy and crisp, with palate-satisfying flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples."
"Soft, simple and a little sweet, with candied pineapple, lemon and lime flavors touched with butterscotchy, vanilla oak."
"Pretty oaky, with toothpicky vanilla and charred wood flavors dominating everything else. Underneath is an okay wine, with pineapple and honey flavors."
"With very ripe pineapple and pear flavors, this Chard also has a taste like cheddar cheese-dusted buttered popcorn. Crisp acidity helps to provide balance."
"Although this Chard is unoaked, its has strong flavors of vanilla and crème brûlée, in addition to the tropical fruits, roasted green apples and sweet lemon custard. It's direct and strong, an inexpensive Chard to pair with rich fare, like scallops in cream sauce."
"An easy-drinking, tasty Chardonnay at a pretty good price. Shows Central Coast acidity and bright flavors of limes, pineapples and pears, with a touch of sweet oak."
"A good Chardonnay, if a little unbalanced, showing some green, minty notes to the citrus and oak. Despite the rich creaminess, feels somewhat unripe. Drink now."
"Generously oaked, with crème caramel and butterscotch from the barrels, this Chard also features very ripe underlying fruit flavors of golden mango and pineapple marmalade. It's fancy and generous, if a bit straightforward."
"Will satisfy fans of the modern, popular Chardonnay style of upfront, sweetly ripe pear, peach and apricot jam flavors, a honeyed, creamy texture, and plenty of sweet, toasted oak."
"Creamy and oaky, with butterscotch and pear notes, but heavy and a bit unripe, with vegetal notes."
"Tastes like apricot pie filling, mixed with vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, with the smoky pastry crust. Simple and direct."
"A beautiful Chardonnay, creamy, dry and elegant. There's a tangy minerality underlying the rich tropical fruit, apple, pear and buttered toast flavors. This is an elegant and sophisticated wine from the Carneros region."
"Very dry, acidic and minerally, this is not one of those lush, decadent Chardonnays. It shows controlled flavors of citrus fruits, pears, wet stones and spices. The malolactic fermentation was prevented, giving it tangy acidity. Give it a try with shellfish and roast salmon."
"This is a tremendous, powerful Chardonnay that swamps the mouth with ripe fruit and oak. It detonates with pineapple crème brûlée, peach tart, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, and while it's dry, it has a honey-sweet finish and a crisp, citrus acid tartness. Drink now."
"You won't miss the taste of oak one bit, because this Chard is so rich and crisply stimulating on its own. It floods the palate with pineapple jam, peach pie, green apple butter, vanilla and cinnamon-honey granola flavors that are clean and pure."
"A very good, delicious Chardonnay that's easy to drink, and whose richness suggests shrimp, scallops, lobster and similarly rich fare. Dry and crisp in acidity, it wows with pineapple marmalade, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, brightened with zesty acidity."
"This is an elaborate, oaky Chardonnay made in the popular style that has made California Chard such a success. It's rich in pineapple jam, apricot, buttered toast, vanilla and leesy flavors, and grows better as it warms in the glass."
"A flowery Chardonnay with delicate, almost evanescent flavors of buttercup, buttered toast and grapefruit. It seems overly strong in oak and weak in fruit, showing a minerally spine and raw alcohol. Clean and bone dry, but lacks richness and vibrancy."
"Does a good job at expressing ripe, cool-climate Chardonnay character at a fair price. Creamy and smooth, it shows peach, pear, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, with a spicy finish."
"This massive, explosive Chardonnay is marked by extremely ripe pineapple, pear and peach fruit, accented with lots of sweet, caramelized oak. It's a potent, high alcohol wine whose buttered popcorn flavors are complex by crisp acidity and minerals. A bit obvious, but a fine example of its style."
"Made in a leaner, crisper style than many Chards nowadays, this Chardonnay trades power for elegance. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrusy acids framing flavors of limes, pineapples and green apples that have a minerally edge. New French oak adds just the right touch of richness."
"With high alcohol and 100% new French oak, this wine could easily be clumsy, but it isn't. It defines the ripe California style. It's a little hot, but so massive in flavors of pineapples, lemondrop candy, crème brûlée and sweet buttered toast, you can't help but be impressed. A winery and wine to watch."
"The oak contributes buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors to this dry, crisp wine, but the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support all that weight. Shows only modest flavors of pineapples, kiwis and minerals. Disappointing."
"Dry and zesty in acidity, this Chard offers flavors of apricots, green apples, pears and butter cream. It's pretty good for this everyday price."
"This food-friendly Chardonnay is California's equivalent of great Chablis. It's totally dry and high in acidity, with elegantly structured flavors of citrus fruits, white peaches, apricots, minerals and yeasty lees. Give it a good decant, and don't serve too cold."
"A great Hanzell Chardonnay, which means you don't want to drink it now. Dry and acidic, it's an aloof young wine whose minerality gives it a tough tang of steel despite a heart of citrus fruit. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar, and it will develop interestingly beyond that."
"Creamy and tartly acidic, with sour pineapple candy, pear, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. Made in a popular style that will appeal to fans of oaky Chards."
"Sweet and simple in vanilla custard and buttered popcorn flavors, with a blast of pineapple jam. If you like fruity sweetness, it's for you."
"Tastes like the mashed pulp of ultra-ripe peaches, pears and limes, sprinkled with vanilla and cinnamon and brightened with crisp, zesty Central Coast acidity."
"Good price for a California Chard of this sophistication. It's dry, creamy and a little soft, with textbook Chardonnay flavors of peaches, pears, pineapples and smoky spices."
"For all the richness, and there's plenty of it in the pineapple, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla notes, this Chard has a gunmetal minerality that grounds it. The “Nu” designation indicates that it's unoaked."
"Made in the familiar style that is K-J Vintner's Reserve, this Chardonnay shows pineapple, lemondrop, mineral and spice flavors balanced with crisp coastal acidity."
"A rustic Chardonnay, with a sweet-and-sour orange sauce flavor and a creamy texture."
"Tastes sour and bone dry, with grapefruit flavors."
"Very ripe in fruit, with good acidity and lots of smoky oak. Made in the jammy style of California Chardonnay, it has sweet flavors of pineapples, papayas and buttered toast. Drink now as a cocktail, or try with a rich shellfish risotto."
"This is a big, rich, oaky Chardonnay. It's a little heavy with all that caramel and buttered toast, but acidity brightens the pineapple and peach flavors, and the finish is clean and spicy."
"This is a high acid, dry and minerally Chardonnay that you can call Chablisian. It has flavors of grilled lemons, limes and pineapples, with richer notes of sweet oak and lees and the buttered toast of oak. Defined by elegance, it should develop bottle complexities over the next three or four years."
"A very nice, elegant Chardonnay that shows plenty of creamy, oaky richness of pineapples, limes and pears, but also a crisp streak of acidity and minerality that provides grounding and balance. A good example of Russian River precision."
"Malolactic fermentation and oak aging have made this wine sweetly buttery and rich, with underlying waves of mangoes, Meyer lemons, pineapples and papayas. It's a big, flamboyant Chardonnay."
"New oak dominates this pleasant Chardonnay, with buttered toast, vanilla and caramelized buttercream notes that are almost sweet, although the wine is technically dry. The underlying flavors are of pineapples, pears and green apples. It's holding up well for a 2007. From La Crema."
"Crisp acidity and laser-pure fruit immediately characterize this as a Central Coast Chardonnay. It's not a blockbuster, but with zesty pineapple, apricot and peach flavors, it's a great buy at this price."
"There's a flowery note to this Chardonnay, which is dry, crisply acidic and strong in flavor in its youth. Brims with pineapple tart filling, Key lime pie, orange zest, honeysuckle, daffodil and smoky, vanilla-oak flavors, with a creamy, yeasty richness. Would benefit from greater restraint and subtlety, which may come after 3–5 years in the bottle. If you drink it now, give it a good decanting."
"Strong in flavor, showing the ripeness and crispness of all Bjornstad's Chardonnays, with lemondrop, lime tart, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. Very good, but doesn't quite have the elegance and refinement of the vineyard bottlings."
"A creamy texture houses vivid flavors of pineapple jam, lemon pie, vanilla custard and buttered toast in this rich wine. It's an opulent Chardonnay made for elegant fare."
"Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple marmalade, lemon custard, vanilla and smoky meringue flavors. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.9%."
"A standard, everyday Chard, brimming with smoky, vanilla-accented oak and ripe pear and tropical fruit flavors that finish a little sweet."
"An awkward Chardonnay that's too strong and exaggerated for balance. Shows New World flavors of superripe pineapple jam and vanilla custard, with a honey-sweet finish."
"Lots of oaky richness in this dry, crisp Chardonnay. It has high acidity and a dusty minerality, but also a thick coat of sweet, butterscotchy oak and powerful flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and exotic tropical fruits. Drink over the next four years."
"Powerful and intense in flavors of pineapples, mangoes, sweet cream and buttered popcorn, with good acidity. Flamboyant, but it feels over-worked and too sweet."
"Smells bright, citrusy and clean, an impression followed in the mouth, where intricate flavors of pineapple, lemondrop candy and Key lime pie turn spicy on the finish. The acidity is brisk; the wine did not go through malolactic fermentation. Just shows that a great Chardonnay doesn't need oak, although sur lies aging gives it a notable creaminess."
"Ceago's Reserve seems a little top-heavy in oak. The caramel and woodsap coating smothers the underlying wine, which is very fine, to judge by the winery's '07 unoaked Chard."
"Shows the very dry herbal, floral and tobacco flavors that often mark Napa Chardonnays (and the vineyard is on the Napa side of Carneros). But there's a good core of tropical citrus fruits, while oak adds needed richness of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now."
"Dry and crisp in cool-climate coastal acidity, this polished Chard shows pretty flavors of pineapples, green apples, honey and oak spice. It's creamy, and made in the New World style."
"A fairly rich Chard whose creamy texture holds fruit-forward, smoky flavors of baked apples, grilled pineapples, vanilla, butterscotch, and dusty Asian spices. Drink now."
"Sweet and simple, with flavors of apricot and pineapple jelly."
"New oak dominates the aromas and flavors, with buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramel overwhelming the underlying fruit, which suggests pineapples and green apples. Although the wine is dry and acidity is fine, the fruit lacks the richness to support the oak."
"A brilliant Chardonnay, easily deserving its Reserve status. Crisp and dry, it houses opulent flavors of ripe tropical fruits, butterscotch, roasted hazelnuts, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice."
"Tangy acidity marks this dry wine. It gives a prickly sensation to the pineapple, peach and pear fruit flavors, almost as if it were slightly sparkling. Not unpleasant, just offbeat."
"A sound, good Chardonnay that offers popular flavors made in the modern way. The wine is soft and dry, with ripe notes of pineapples, pears, buttered toast and butterscotch."
"A real fruit bomb, with explosive flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and peaches, accented with sweet smoky oak. Malolactic fermentation adds softer flavors of buttered popcorn."
"Rich and creamy, with fruit-forward flavors of pineapple jam, oranges, ripe peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity gives balance and clean liveliness."
"Flowery and sweet, with apricot, buttercup and banana flavors in a soft texture."
"Dry and crisp, with a fine, clean minerality, this Chardonnay is dominated by the vanilla and toast of oak. The underlying wine shows pineapple, Asian pear and lime flavors. It's elegant, but a little thin."
"A pure, young Chardonnay made in a Chablis style, but you don't want to drink it now. Shows the acidic minerality of Carneros, with citrus, tropical fruit, wildflower and honey flavors. Too tight and unyielding. Give it until mid-2010 to mellow."
"Like all Thomas Fogarty's Chardonnays, this is dry, acidic and minerally. It is not one of those ultrarich Chards dripping with buttered popcorn and tropical fruit jam. Wine aficionados will appreciate the Chablis-like citrus fruit, white flower and steel elegance."
"Held back longer than most Chardonnays, this single-vineyard wine is beginning to pick up bottle complexity. It's a connoisseur's wine, not dazzlingly rich and sweet, but dry, acidic and minerally, with lemon and orange citrus fruit flavors. You have to appreciate subtlety to like this artisanal wine. Should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years."
"The vineyard is far better known for powerful, concentrated Pinot Noir, and this Chardonnay shares those characteristics. It's a big, fruity wine, not showing much finesse, but plenty of sheer magnitude. Brims with tropical fruit, apple, exotic spice and oak flavors that finish dry. Could do interesting things over the years."
"Tastes like it comes from Edna Valley, with its dryness, great burst of juicy acidity and jammy Mandarin orange, lime, kiwi and Meyer lemon flavors. Great with crab cakes dressed in a mango salsa."
"Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture. The oak is flamboyant, but perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dazzling and dramatic, from a vineyard that just keeps performing better and better."
"Massively rich, with pronounced, sweet, smoky oak flavors and a rich vein of tart, creamy lees highlighting the underlying fruity ripeness. Shows flavors of grilled pineapples, tropical mangoes and pears, balanced with crisp acids. Tremendously delicious and compelling."
"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill."
"This is a sort of second tier wine from Talbott. It's a strongly flavored Chardonnay and extremely ripe, with pineapple jam, apricot-infused crème brûlée and sweet vanilla-butterscotch flavors. But for all the richness, it's crisp and bone dry. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases."
"The best Chardonnays from this warm Sonoma County valley show tropical fruit flavors and are quite decadent, and this is one of the best. With crisp acidity, it brims with pineapple crème brûlée, papaya and vanilla custard. Drink this opulent wine with rich fare, such as scallops, crab and lobster."
"A beautiful Chardonnay, solidly in the Gainey style of balance and integrity, but also showing the cool climate terroir of its origins as well as the excellence of the vintage. The result is this crisp, richly oaked but balanced young wine. It brims with tropical fruits and spices."
"Buena Vista has a good reputation for this bottling, and the great '07 vintage has resulted in another fine Chardonnay, at a good price. Racy in acidity, the wine shows mineral-infused citrus fruit, apple and honeysuckle notes that finish with a touch of off-dry sweetness."
"Marked by dryness and crisp acidity, this Chardonnay has intricate flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, Asian pears and sweet, smoky oak, with a fine minerality. Classic and complex, it should develop in the bottle for up to six years."
"Comes down on the opposite side of the spectrum from the opulent 2006, a bone-dry, acidic young Chardonnay marked more by minerals than fruit. With citrus, papaya and floral notes and a tang of cold steel, it has a leesy yeastiness that adds complex interest. Compelling, and possibly ageworthy."
"Strikes an interesting balance between richness and austerity. Will fascinate true connoisseurs for its mineral-laden suggestions of dried lemons and kaffir limes, and the way sweet oak elaborates them. Crisp acidity provides the final balance of mouthwatering tartness. A true Chablis-style Chardonnay, at a fair price."
"Chardonnay doesn't get much richer or riper than this. Explodes with grilled pineapple, lemondrop, smoky meringue, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened and boosted by crisp, citrusy cool-climate acidity. Racy and clean and complex, it should develop bottle nuance over the next four years."
"Overtly sweet, like sugared peach and lemon juice, fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. If you like that off-dry taste, it's for you."
"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now."
"Made in the extracted New World style, this Chard has jammy apricot, pineapple and pear flavors liberally drenched in butterscotch-scented, smoky oak. The grapes come from Santa Lucia Highlands and Paso Robles."
"Ultradry and tart in acidity, this is not a Chardonnay for those looking for richness. With citrus and mineral flavors, it's suggestive of a young, minor Chablis. Clean and vibrant. Drink now."
"Here's a good everyday Chardonnay. It's rich and creamy, with forward fruit flavors of peaches, pineapples and ripe pears that finish slightly sweet."
"Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness."
"This bottling by veteran Foxen offers one of the starkest, most appealing choices available in California Chardonnay. Far from a superripe buttery monster, it's a lean, elegant machine. With vibrant acidity and a mineral undergirding, it offers rich flavors of citrus fruits and rind and yeasty, Champagne-like lees."
"Clean, lean and elegant, with mineral-infused citrus and green apple flavors set off by crisp acidity. There's no oak, but somehow the wine has a vanilla and honey richness."
"This is the winery's first Chard with a Sonoma Coast appellation, and it's drier and more acidic and minerally than past bottlings. That's a good thing. It makes the wine a standout partner for food. With subtle lime, green apple, green pea and smoky oak flavors, it's a crisp, versatile wine across a vast range of fare."
"The fruit stars in this tasty Chardonnay. Pineapples, pears, mangoes, green apples and Key lime pie dance on the palate. A touch of oak adds vanilla cream and buttered toast. Drink now."
"Too sweet and oaky for comfort, with caramelized flavors of pineapple and apple juice that finish with a white sugar aftertaste."
"Superrich in pears, pineapples and green apples, and oaky, with butterscotch, buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors. Massive and direct, but balanced with crisp acidity. Drink now."
"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced."
"Pretty good price for what you get. Shows everyday flavors of pears, pineapples and peaches, with a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon. Best Buy."
"Fruity and oaky, if a bit direct. It offers vanilla, buttered popcorn, pineapple crème brûlée and Asian spice flavors. Drink now."
"What a fine Chardonnay. Made in a bone dry, minerally style, it may not have the immediately seductive quality of some Chards, but it does show a Chablis-like elegance that makes it a natural for food pairing, with its fine citrus and steel tang and mouthwatering acidity."
"Made in an exaggerated, oaky style that's dominated by caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors, with undertones of pineapple crème brûlée and ultra-ripe peaches."
"Another massive, dramatically rich Chardonnay from Williams Selyem. Purists will find it ponderous, but there's no denying the wealth of pineapple tart, orange custard, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. Lobster comes to mind as a natural partner."
"Nice and dry, with brisk acidity framing pineapple, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, boosted with a touch of smoky oak."
"An everyday Chardonnay, useful for a wide variety of purposes. Shows a creamy texture with flavors of apricots and citrus."
"A little on the watery-thin side, with apricot and pear flavors. Finishes dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity."
"Marked by penetrating acidity that's almost stinging, this Chard is balanced with a creamy, buttery texture framing rich flavors of pineapple tart, Key lime pie and smoky butterscotch. Good price for a wine of this depth and complexity."
"Offering none of the oaky, fruity richness of popular Chardonnays, this bottle needs to be figured out in a different way. It's super-dry, acidic and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors that seem barely touched by oak. It's a wine of structural integrity, made in the style of a great Chablis. One of the rare Chardonnays that should age."
"Tremendously rich and oaky, with butterscotch-inspired pineapple, golden mango pear and Meyer lemon flavors that are as rich as crème brûlée. Dramatic now, if a bit overpowering. Calls for carefully crafted foods of the richest level, like lobster."
"With brisk Edna Valley acidity and intensely pure Chardonnay fruit flavors of tangerines, limes and sweet Meyer lemon sour candy, this is a pleasant sipper with roasted or grilled salmon, or a barbecue chicken or pork skewer with pineapples, green peppers and onions."
"Gavin Chanin makes this distinctive, interesting Chardonnay. Shows a ino Sherry-like yeastiness, and is minerally and streamlined. Zesty flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits round out the finish."
"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish."
"A fruity, direct Chardonnay that will appeal to fans for its peach, pear and oak flavors. Not especially complicated, but a fine example of the variety at a good price."
"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel."
"This rich, oaky Chardonnay has aromas and flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla and pineapple jam. It's very rich and creamy, and appeals for sheer deliciouness."
"Very bright and acidic, with the savory taste of a sour lemondrop candy. If you're sensitive to acidity you'll find it tart. But it's deliciously layered, with tiers of buttered toast, vanilla and spice."
"This is a good, sound, everyday Chardonnay. It's very dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with mineral-laded flavors of lemons, limes, apples and pineapples, touched with vanilla and buttered toast."
"This is a decadently rich Chardonnay, although it depends for its appeal mainly on oak and ripe fruit, rather than nuance. Explodes with pineapple jam, golden mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors. Ready now."
"A wonderfully drinkable Chardonnay that shows brilliant coastal character and lots of richness, at a decent price. Crisp and dry, it has elaborate flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice."
"Chardonnay has not been Silverado's strong suit in recent years and the tight, lean 2008 does not alter that conclusion. The wine is dry and acidic, with citrus and apple flavors that lack charm."
"Brisk in acids, with lush, long hangtime lemon, kiwi, tangerine and vanilla flavors. It's all upfront in this drily delicious Chardonnay."
"This is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay, built on a foundation of superripe pineapple, lime and golden mango fruit and elaborated with sweet, caramelized oak. Bright, zesty Edna Valley acidity balances the opulence."
"An extravagant Chardonnay, rich in buttered toast and vanilla cream from oak barrels, and opulent fruit flavors of ripe, sweet pineapples, golden mangoes and pears. The sur lie aging shows up in a creamy, yeasty richness. Holding this wine for a year or two will not harm it."
"A fine, useful Chardonnay, made in the modern ripe style. Bursts with juicy pineapple, Key lime pie, Meyer lemon, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, accented with crisp coastal acidity."
"A very nice, super-drinkable Chardonnay marked by brisk, cool-climate acidity and a bracing minerality. The pineapple, peach and apple flavors have the slight herbality you often find in Napa Chardonnay."
"Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple jam, kiwi, pear and green apple, and notes of vanilla, buttered popcorn and cream. Defines the fruit-forward, buttery style of Chardonnay in a soft, forward way."
"Rich and showy, but a little too strong in everything, showing flamboyant tropical fruit, caramelized oak, butterscotch and sweet vanilla cream flavors. It's all quite delicious, but the wine ultimately lacks subtlety and distinction, especially at this price."
"Lots of leesy, vanilla richness in this New World-style Chardonnay. It brims with mango, orange and cinnamon spice flavors. Will satisfy fans of this sweet, creamy approach."
"An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California. Dazzles with tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with a brilliant overlay of oak that adds buttered toast and spice flavors, not to mention sturdy oak tannins. But it's the zesty acidity, like a squirt of lime juice, that really elevates this wine."
"Strong and ripe and oaky. Not showing much subtlety, but a very good example of the modern California style. It's a clean, vibrant Chardonnay starring massive flavors of pineapple tart, Meyer lemon custard and tangerines, brightened with zesty acidity."
"Dry and tart, with flavors of pineapples, apples, vanilla and toast. A solid Chardonnay at an everyday price."
"A sweet, simple Chardonnay, tasting like the juice from canned peaches, pears and pineapples, slightly sweetened, with touches of smoky oak. Satisfies your basic Chardonnay sweet tooth."
"Made in the modern way of very ripe fruit and lots of oak, this Chardonnay certainly delivers plenty of pineapple jam, tangerine, Meyer lemon tart, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Designed for the Chard crowd that likes this popular style."
"Soft and creamy, with flavors of buttered toast, pineapple marmalade and candy corn. Made in the ripe, oaky, drink-me-now modern style."
"There's lots to like about this cool-climate Chardonnay, from the ripe pineapple, kiwi and lime flavors to the rich touch of lees and vanilla. It has a sharp cut of acidity that's almost Champagne-like, and calls for extremely rich fare to balance. Try with shrimp risotto."
"Very ripe, rich and oaky, made solidly in the California style. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, but rewards for decadent pineapple, pear, crème brûlée, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors."
"Shows the purity of flavor and structure that Bonterra wines are famous for. Ultraclean and racy in acidity, this Chardonnay stars ripe varietal flavors of pineapples, oranges and limes. A touch of oak adds welcome richness."
"This enormously rich Chardonnay was grown in the winery's dramatic mountain vineyard. It's powerful in concentrated pineapple jam and lemon fruit, while winemaker interventions add creamy notes of vanilla, honey and buttered toast. What it trades in nuance, it more than makes up for in sheer power."
"Too much oak on this Chardonnay. It's dominated by the aromas and flavors of buttered toast and caramelized, vanilla accented wood. Underneath all that are some pretty good pineapple, peach and pear flavors."
"Superripe and oaky in pineapple, white peach purée, pear tart, buttered toast and vanilla-infused crème brûlée, this Chardonnay is saved from mere richness by crisp coastal acidity and a fine spine of minerals. Exotic and delicious, it's at its best now."
"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary vanilla and pineapple jam flavors. Could be a Starbucks drink. Saved a bit by crisp acidity."
"Great price for a big production (5,000 cases) Chardonnay of this quality. It's dry and crisp and elegantly structured, with savory citrus fruit, peach, mineral and vanilla flavors. Easily as good as many Chards far more costly. From Don Sebastiani & Sons."
"Great price for a Chardonnay of this quality. The grapes come from cool coastal areas, and the wine brims with crisp, long hangtime ripeness, accented with toasty oak. Feels rich and creamy, with pineapple, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors."
"A fine Chardonnay, showing cool weather influence in the brisk acidity and ripe flavors, which veer toward tart green apples, peaches and tangerines. The oak has been tastefully applied."
"This Chiles Valley producer, on the eastern edge of the Napa Valley, has made a big Chardonnay that doesn't exude much aromatically at first and veers sweet, but is otherwise balanced and could develop some interesting minerality over time."
"Ordinary and one-dimensional. The grapes got superripe under the California sun, offering big flavors of pineapples and peaches, liberally accented with oak. But there's not much going on below the surface."
"A bit quick on the finish, but otherwise a nice everyday Chardonnay. Shows a soft, buttercream texture, with dry, subtle flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast."
"A deliciously savory wine, brisk in lip-smacking acidity, with the strong, pure flavors of limes, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruits that mark this cool climate region of San Luis Obispo County. Pretty much as good as Edna Valley Chardonnay gets. Drink now."
"Very rich and fruity, offering waves of ripe crushed pineapples, pears, vanilla bean, buttered popcorn and spices. What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for in sheer power."
"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass."
"Made in a Chablis style, this Chardonnay is bone dry and crisp in acidity. The pineapple and peach flavors are integrated with stony minerals. It's not a complex wine, but is super-clean and zesty, a nice complement to shellfish, mushroom risotto or a perfectly roasted chicken."
"A ponderous Chardonnay, marked by excessive new oak flavors and the heavy hand of the winemaker. Shows pineapple, pear and tangerine flavors, but the barrel and malolactic additions soften and sweeten them."
"A sweet, simple Chardonnay, with pineapple and orange jam flavors and oak-like vanilla and caramel influences."
"Thin in orange, apricot and vanilla flavors, with soft acidity, this Chardonnay is okay for big parties and fast food."
"Another Best Buy for this delightful everyday Chardonnay. Shows flavors of peaches and cream, buttered toast and pineapples, with a nice, flowery edge."
"Awesomely rich, showing fine acidity and a stony minerality that ground and anchor it, but really notable for the explosive tropical fruit, apricot, pear and buttery oak flavors that are so opulent. The wine went through a complete malolactic fermentation."
"Hanzell says this Sebella Chardonnay is meant to drink now, while their regular Chardonnay, which is famously ageable, develops in the cellar. That's strange logic, because the wine is so close to the regular Chardonnay as to be nearly indistinguishable. It's bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally, with citrus, green apple and pear flavors. Give it 3–5 years."
"Shows the richness of fruit, as well as oak, that has lately characterized this Monterey-grown Chardonnay, with very ripe pineapple and crème brûlée flavors. Feels somewhat obvious, lacking the subtle appeal of the 2007. Drink now."
"This is a strong, direct Chardonnay that offers no subtlety, but impresses for sheer power. It dazzles with tangerine, pineapple and peach flavors, with plenty of new oak. Ready now."
"Fans of the ripe, modern style of Chardonnay will fall in love with this bottling. It's strong in toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream and peach, pear and pineapple jam flavors that dazzle and wow the palate. Easy to find, with nearly 17,000 cases produced."
"A rich, oaky wine that will appeal to lots of Chardonnay fans. It's creamy and smooth, with tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast flavors."
"Doesn't seem to have much, if any, oak on it, but it doesn't matter, because the underlying wine is so good, at such a nice price. Crisp and steely, it shows rich flavors of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and pears."
"Tastes old and tired, losing fruit and turning herbal, nutty and earthy, with dried apricot and orange flavors. Interesting from a connoisseur's point of view, but it's hard to tell why Mayacamas held back this wine for so long."
"Marked by high acidity and stony minerals, this is an austerely elegant Chardonnay. Its natural lime and Meyer lemon flavors have been enriched with sweet oak. Shows the pedigreed finesse of its chilly climate estate origin. Drink now."
"Simple, with fruit punch-sweet pineapple and lemon flavors. High acidity makes it a little sour."
"Overoaked and tired, a simple, sweet Chardonnay with buttered popcorn and pineapple jam flavors."
"The perfect California cool-climate Chardonnay. It's balanced and elegant, yet opulent, with beautiful acidity giving brightness to the ripe tangerine, pineapple, buttered toast, cinnamon and crème brûlée flavors."
"Shows the bone-dry, crisply acidic minerality of the winery's Chardonnays, a brisk, elegant wine whose complexities make it fascinating. The lemon and lime flavors are enriched with a touch of oak and lees. Try aging for six years to experience an aged California Chardonnay."
"A deliciously complex Chardonnay, nearly as good as the winery's single-vineyard wines, which makes it a great value. Smooth and clean, it shows vanilla cream, pineapple tart, Key lime pie and buttered toast flavors. Vibrant acidity keeps it all uplifted and bright."
"Very fine, showing the class of this vineyard, at a great price. Although the wine is thoroughly dry, it's vast in pineapple and lime fruit, with a minerally tang from the terroir and rich, sweet buttered toast and vanilla notes from oak barrel aging. The minerality reprises throughout, giving the wine a steely authority."
"Lots of tangy acidity in this Chard, and tannins too. It has a grainy, stubborn mouthfeel. Shows plenty of pineapple, orange, apricot and lime flavors, with sweet oak essence, but cant quite overcome that resistant tug. Drink now."
"This is a good, dry Chardonnay, marked by brisk acidity and a steely minerality. The fruit veers toward pineapples and apricots, while oak adds notes of buttered toast and caramel. Feels like it wants to be richer than it is, but it's elegant."
"Clean, brisk and balanced, with good varietal flavors of pineapples, limes, peaches and exotic tropical fruits, brightened with zesty acidity. This is a good price for a classic California Chardonnay."
"This very rich Chardonnay oozes showy flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes, with winemaking notes of buttered toast, crème brûlée and a slight taste of yeast. It's not particularly subtle, projecting power instead."
"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough."
"This is easily the greatest of Foxen's new Chardonnays. It show the dryness and crisp acidity of the other bottlings, but is enormously rich and complex in oak-inspired pineapple, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and mineral flavors. Decant for a while to let it mellow, and it should develop bottle complexity through 2014."
"Shows very bright acidity and a firm minerality, which gives it a tangy, mouthwatering vitality. Rich, too, in lemondrop candy, pineapple jam and spice flavors. The oak has been tastefully applied, with just- right notes of buttered toast. A flattering, balanced, elegant Chardonnay for drinking soon."
"With 50% new oak, there's a lot of buttered toast and smoky vanilla on this Chard, but the fruit easily handles it. Fabulously rich in pineapple, honey and crème brûlée. Soft and fat in the mouth, maybe with a touch of botrytis. Very fine, extraordinary opulence. Drink now."
"Simple and sweet, like a mango, pineapple and peach fruit juice blend. Not much going on, but will appeal to lots of Chard lovers at this price. Production was half a million cases."
"Sugary sweet and simple, with fruit juice flavors of pineapples, mangoes, oranges and peaches. Gets the basic Chardonnay job done."
"Simple, with jammy pineapple, mango and vanilla cream flavors that finish sugary sweet."
"Fog Crest's Chardonnays have been getting sweeter and oakier, it seems, and this is their most desserty-sweet yet. It's like a vanilla cream cocktail, infused with pineapple liqueur, with a slice of tangerine."
"This Chardonnay remains dry and resistant in acids and tannins. The flavors are elusive, suggesting minerals and lemons, with plenty of brisk, citrusy acidity."
"Sweet and simple in apricot and pineapple flavors, with a heavy coating of caramelized oak. Drinkable, but disagreeably fruit-juicy."
"Vegetal, with an asparagus edge to the citrus fruit flavors. That mars this otherwise clean, dry and zesty Chardonnay."
"Here's a simple wine that tastes like a supermarket fruit juice blend of peaches, mangoes and apricots. It's soft and one-dimensional and slightly sweet in the finish."
"Will satisfy Chard fans who like ripe fruit and plenty of oak. Shows pineapple marmalade, orange fruit cake, vanilla, buttered popcorn and smoky oak flavors, finished with brisk acidity."
"Bone dry and tart in citrusy acidity, this is a Chablis-style Chardonnay. It has a firm minerality grounding clean flavors of sour pineapple candy, with richer notes of vanilla and smoky oak. Elegant and food-friendly."
"A beautiful Chardonnay, rich and ripe in fruit, yet balanced with dryness and racy acidity and a fine minerality. The pineapple and orange flavors are accented with sweet, smoky oak. Drink this luxuriously elegant wine now."
"As sweet as a dessert drink, with sugared pineapple juice, vanilla custard and spice flavors. Yet it's balanced with crisp acidity, and finishes clean. If this is your style, it's for you."
"Lightly oaked, this Chardonnay is sweet and forward in pineapple jam, buttered popcorn and caramelized flavors. It's balanced with crisp, Central Coast acidity."
"Raw and simple, with lemon and lime flavors that taste unnaturally oaked in sweet smoky vanilla."
"Dry, acidic and watery, with a suggestion of lemon and lime fruit."
"Sweet in fruit and oak, with simple, candied flavors of pineapple jam and vanilla custard."
"Lots of rich, forward pineapple, ripe pear jam, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors in this Chardonnay. It will satisfy your sweet tooth, with its honey-rich finish. Drink now."
"Lush in pineapple cream, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and apricot flavors, this Chardonnay is as rich as they come. There's also a welcome overlay of zesty, citrusy acidity. The finish is honey sweet, in the modern style."
"Tasty and rich, this unoaked Chardonnay is very ripe and crisp, with vanilla and honey touches to the candied lemondrop, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors. Drink now."
"This is an austere Chardonnay whose minerality and acidity star. That's not to say it's not fruity. It has pineapple and green apple flavors, with oak and lees adding richer complexities. Still, it's a firm, Chablis-style wine, and a very good one that defines the elegant sleekness of the Sonoma Coast."
"The aromas and tastes of oak dominate this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and sweet caramel riding high over the pineapple, mango and pear flavors. But crisp acidity provides needed balance, and there's a fine minerality that gives a tang of stone. A good price for a Chard this complicated."
"Shows lots of flamboyant pineapple, pear and green apple flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. But the wine is uplifted by a firm, steely minerality, as well as fine acids. It finishes a little sweet. Drink now."
"Lean and minerally, with dry, crisp Meyer lemon, pineapple and toasty oak flavors. Starts off a bit sulfury and seems rushed to market. Better by mid-2010."
"Great price for a Chardonnay this rich and tasty. It has a buttery, creamy texture, framing tart flavors of pineapples, peaches and vanilla oak."
"Tastes fruity and tart in Lifesaver orange, lemon and apricot flavors, enriched with oak and brightened with beautifully crisp acidity. Feels strong and flattering now. Let it breathe in the glass."
"One of the leanest, most severe Chardonnays out there. In its favor is extreme dryness, elegance and a refreshing minerality. But the citrus flavors are so thin, there's just not much going on, and a little oak doesn't help. Simply lacks richness."
"Dry, crisp and austere, although it's elegant in its own way. Shows citrus, mineral and lees flavors, with some creamy, buttered toast notes."
"Williams Selyem is now playing the unoaked game, and with their fruit sources, wow. Most winemakers would kill to put oak onto these grapes. The wine is tremendous in pineapples, pears, papayas and kiwi fruit. It's so rich, you won't even notice the absence of caramel and all those oaky influences."
"A very rich, flamboyant style of Chardonnay, showing caramelized oak, vanilla, buttered toast and plenty of ripe pineapple, sweet lime and honey richness. But it's balanced with crisp acidity. Drink now."
"A charming Chardonnay, not the biggest, baddest around, but crisp and linear and elegant. Shows saline, umami-infused lime, Meyer lemon and crème brûlée flavors, with zesty acidity. Finishes balanced and complex."
"A tartly acidic, slightly green wine, with mineral, peach, green grape and pineapple flavors. Turns sweet-and-sour on the finish."
"Too acidic, almost sour, and pretty sweet, with pineapple and orange flavors. Gets the Chardonnay job done, but seems pricey for what you get."
"Nicely dry, tart in acidity and clean, but flavor-wise, there's not much going on. The tastes are of minerals and alcohol, with a squirt of citrus juice."
"Very tart, almost sour in acidity, with unnaturally sweet pineapple, buttered toast and caramel flavors."
"This Chardonnay in a box is the equivalent of four regular bottles, but it's not a very good wine. It's ultradry and acidic, with unripe, vegetal flavors that just approach citrus fruits."
"A bit vegetal, and a bit sweet on the finish in pineapple candy. Not particularly successful."
"Made in the popular style, with vanilla oak, cream and sweet buttered popcorn notes dominating the pineapples, apricots and peaches. Production was 8,093 cases."
"The initial impression of this Chardonnay is of intense pineapple, pear and tropical fruit flavors, but then the minerality and acidity kick in, and the wine feels grounded and vital. It's a lovely effort, rich and intense yet light and ephemeral."
"A very dry, acidic young Chardonnay, marked by oak influence. The basic wine is tart and ripe in citrus and peach fruit, while barrels add richer notes of vanilla cream and buttered toast. Lees stirring is evident in the Champagne-like yeastiness. An elegant Chard to drink now."
"Dry, streamlined and acidic, with suggestions of peaches, apples, vanilla, cream and cinnamon. A decent everyday Chardonnay with a touch of smoky oak."
"A good wine, comprised of fruit from vineyards scattered across Santa Barbara County. It's bone dry and crisp in acidity, and also pretty oaky. The underlying fruit flavors are of apricots and pears, with perhaps a touch of botrytis. Ready to drink now."
"Very rich, reflecting 100% barrel fermentation in partial new oak and 100% malolactic fermentation. Under the creamy lees and buttered toast are scads of pineapples, pears and papayas. The grapes come from the Nielson Vineyard."
"A pure, clean Chardonnay whose dry richness is balanced with cool-climate acidity and a citrus streak almost like Sauvignon Blanc. Shows pineapple and pear flavors that indicate the varietal, but then crisp, tartly acidic lemongrass and grapefruits kick in. The result is wonderfully food-friendly. Easy to find, with 10,600 cases produced."
"Ripe and soft, a creamy Chard with flavors of buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and vanilla. Finishes almost as sweet as a Starbucks drink."
"Shows the ripe pineapple fruit, acidity, minerality and above all sweet, smoky oak that mark a rich California Chardonnay. But there's something off. Hard to say exactly what, but it's in the taste. Like a smattering of mold or shriveled grapes that's off-putting."
"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood."
"Shows a marked improvement over the winery's previous Chards, offering real richness of flavor and good structure. With oak-inspired apricot, pear and citrus flavors, it's an upscale wine to drink now."
"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes. Oak aging and lees add fortunate layers of buttered toast and cream. Very intricate, with Chablisian dryness and minerality. Now–2014."
"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation."
"Very tightly wound in high acidity and even some tannins, with austere, aloof citrus flavors. There's not a lot of appeal to this wine now, except a certain dry, yeasty elegance. It's like a sparkling blanc de blancs without the bubbles."
"A simple Chardonnay, with likeable pineapple, apple, lime, kiwi and vanilla flavors. Finishes sweet. Seems pricey for what you get."
"Crisp acidity saves this rather sweet, oaky wine by giving it a clean mouthfeel. The flavors are of pineapple and apple juice, honey and vanilla caramel."
"Slightly sweet, with simple apple and mango juice flavors and a veneer of oak-like vanillins and caramel. Crisp acidity helps to make the finish clean."

"Shows the Farrell mark of elegance, with balanced ripeness and acidity. Bigtime flavors of pineapples and tangerines mingle with caramelized oak, with additional buttered toast and vanilla richness. A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay that shouldn't be consumed too cold."
"Fruity, rich and satisfying. Shows a mélange of pineapple, pear and peach flavors, with creamy vanilla and spice notes, brightened with crisp acidity. Could be a tad drier."
"The mystery of how to make a Chardonnay, is solved with this wine; fruity, rich and creamy, yet one that finishes so dry and crisp in acidity. Who else holds back a Chardonnay five years except Jim Clendenen? Low in alcohol and balanced despite being aged in 100% new French oak, it's just now beginning a long journey of excellence. It has a soft, lilting mouthfeel and incredible complexity that will only improve with time."
"A good, rich Chardonnay, marked by pleasantly crisp acidity and a buttercreamy texture housing fruity flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples and kiwi. Shows good Russian River character. Don't drink it too cold."

Really nice and clean, a lovely wine and a good restaurant by-the-glass selection. Production was 9,000 cases."
"Very ripe and bright in acidity, with clean, vibrant flavors of Meyer lemon custard, Key lime pie, vanilla sorbet and crème brûlée flavors. Could be more elegant, but it's certainly not shy."

"This is a very rich, oaky Chardonnay, ripe and forward in the California style. Although it's dry, it's so fruity and honeyed, it's almost like a dessert wine. Swamps the palate with pineapple jam, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors, which are nicely balanced with crisp acidity."
"Made in the modern California Chardonnay style you'll either love or hate. It's enormously extracted in pineapple tart, crème brûlée and honey-drizzled buttered toast flavors, and the acidity is bright and clean. The superrichness would benefit from greater control."
"Lots of zesty acidity and minerals in this Chardonnay, but also lots of richness. Brims with ripe pineapples, peaches, papayas and green apples, with extra levels of buttered toast and honey. A crowd-pleasing wine to drink now."

"A really nice, elegant Chardonnay at a good price. The wine is dry and lightly oaked, showing rich pineapple, peach, vanilla and buttered toast flavors enhanced with crisp acidity. Only 731 cases were produced of this lovely, food-friendly wine."
"This late-released bottling is incredibly interesting. Connoisseurs will appreciate the bone-dry minerality and acidity, the subtle creaminess from lees aging and the citrusy flavors that just begin to suggest tropical fruit. It should continue to develop in the bottle for a few more years."
"Made with superripe fruit and scads of oak, this Chardonnay tastes like pineapple jam squeezed onto buttered popcorn. Somebody will like it, and it's okay in its own way, but it exemplifies the worst of the New World, oaky style."
"This pretty good everyday Chardonnay shows slightly sweet flavors of peaches, pineapples and mangoes brightened with crisp acidity. You could even make a summertime wine cooler with it."

"This is Cohn's reserve-style Chardonnay and it's easily their best since the 1990s. Made from two vineyards in the cool Carneros district of Sonoma, it's ripe in pineapple and green apple flavors enhanced with the toast of oak, the creaminess of lees and the buttery softness of malolactic fermentation. Easy to drink with opulent fare such as crab."
"This is a strong, oaky, ripe Chardonnay, grown on a mountain better known for Cabernet. It's powerful and intense in pineapple tart, pear marmalade, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that have been liberally oaked, and it shows the creamy influence of lees. Not particularly subtle, it's a wine you don't want to drink too cold."
"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste. Floods the mouth with pineapple tart, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla flavors, with suggestions of kiwis, limes and green apples. Delicious and appealing."
"A beautiful Chardonnay at a great price compared to what's out there. Shows brilliantly ripe pineapple, pear and guava flavors, with crisp Central Coast acidity and a bracing minerality. Nice to drink by itself, with shellfish or even with a citrus fruit pastry for dessert."
"Super-rich in vanilla and smoky caramelized oak, and ripe in pineapples, peaches and apples, this is a powerful Chardonnay. It's dramatic now in sheer strength, but not an ager, so drink now."
"A difficult vintage for the winery, and not the most successful Robert Young Chardonnay. But it does show the elegance of the vineyard. Rich in acids and oak, its underlying flavors are of oranges and pineapples. Drink now, not too cold."
"A solid, direct Chardonnay. Doesn't offer a whole lot of complexity, but it's dry and creamy, with spicy, oak-inspired pineapple and green apple flavors."
"Ripe tropical fruit and oak dominate this overly sweet Chardonnay. It's very rich in pineapple tart, golden mango, buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors, but lacks dry balance. Tastes like there's a lot of white sugar in there."
"Oaky and ripe, this Chardonnay shows barrel-inspired vanilla and buttered toast flavors that enrich the pineapples and apples. A touch of Gewurztraminer lifts it into floral and lychee territory."
"There's an herbal undertow to this wine, with suggestions of dill and sage to the pineapples, green apples and buttercream. It's also soft, lacking the clean vibrancy that a rich Chardonnay requires. Drink now."
"Fruity, with scads of pineapple, green apple, mango and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. It's made in the popular style, at a popular price."
"Thin and acidic, with just the barest suggestion of grapefruit juice. Maybe some pineapples. Earns an extra point or two for dryness and elegance, but really lacks richness."
"Good and rich, but tastes too oaky, with the pineapple, nectarine and peach flavors swamped by vanilla, caramel and butterscotch. Other than that, there's a fine, crisp minerality to the finish."
"Another beautiful Chardonnay from this fine vineyard and winery. The wine is drier than past vintages, but rich in acidity and minerals, with a complex array of pineapple, lime and Meyer lemon citrus flavor. Fermenting half the wine in stainless steel and the balance in oak, a third of which was new, seems to be the perfect approach."
"It's very good, with deep, delicious flavors of tropical fruits, minerals and vanilla, accented with elaborate oak and brightened with crisp acidity. Production was a low 223 cases, but it's worth a search."
"A beautiful wine that asserts itself near the top of the pile of Carneros Chardonnay. Shows brisk acidity and a tangy minerality, with oak-inspired, superripe green apple, Meyer lemon and pear fruit flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture. Drink now."
"A rich, buttery Chardonnay, brimming with well-oaked pineapple, honey, créme brûlée and spice flavors, brightened with acidity. A real crowd pleaser."
"This is a very rich Chardonnay, almost too elaborated and overworked. It's tremendous in oak-infused fruit, with dominating buttered toast, crème brûlée and pineapple pie flavors. Very crisp coastal acidity provides a pleasant balance of tartness. Drink now."
"Fresh tropical fruit, peach and apricot flavors star in this flashy young wine. Oak also plays a prominent role, giving buttered toast and caramel notes. And the texture is creamy and smooth. The overall impression is very rich and powerful, but the wine could have more finesse. Drink now."
"An exotic, dry and crisp Chardonnay, with plenty of toasty oak. Shows a mélange of dried orange, pineapple and pear fruit, with a minerally note. There's a feral quality that may be the result of native yeasts. Drink now."
"This is a dry, firmly crisp Chardonnay, with pineapple, apricot, mineral and vanilla flavors. It's somewhat simple and direct, but very clean and zesty. Nice for drinking now."
"A pretty good Chardonnay, dry and crisp and minerally. It comes from this famous vineyard in the heart of the southern valley, and shows proper flavors of green apples and peaches, with a firm minerality and fine acidity. Not particularly rich, but interesting and complex, and a good companion to food."
"Dry, tart and citrusy. Offers streamlined flavors of lemons, limes, tannic herb tea and minerals, with oak and lees adding much-needed richness. It's elegant in a Chablisian way, but trades fruity opulence for a more complex, connoisseur's austerity. Drink now, and don't over-chill."
"Thin to the point of watery, with very modest citrus flavors but mostly herbs and dried hay. Clean enough, but there's nothing going on."
"A big improvement over the 2007, Stephens' '08 is rich and ripe. It brims with pineapple, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Easy to drink, and delicious through the finish."

"Lush, creamy and smooth, with buttered toast, lemon custard, crême brulée and spice flavors. Maybe a little overworked, but it satisfies Chardonnay cravings."

"The winery has held this wine back for nearly three years, but it's still briskly acidic and clean. Grown in the Arroyo Seco appellation, it shows forward, bright flavors of tangerines, mangoes and Asian pears, with complexities from oak and lees aging."
"This oaky, ripe, fruit-forward Chardonnay will appeal to fans of the California style. It's massive in pineapple jam, lemondrop candy and vanilla crème brûlée flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. A little obvious, but delicious."
"There are masses of pineapple, apricot, orange and green apple fruit in this Chardonnay, accented with strong Carneros acidity. Quite a good wine, but once you get past the flavors, it falls off in interest. Could be a rare Chardonnay sleeper. Try giving it 2–3 years in the cellar."
"Made in the modern, ripe style, but with a greater degree of finesse than you might expect at this price. The wine is dry and crisp and minerally, with a clean mouthfeel, yet offers rich flavors of pineapples, green apples and peaches. Easy to find, with more than 12,000 cases produced."
"It's all there in this Chardonnay, with barrel influences of butterscotch and toast, crisp Russian River acidity, and ripe flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples. Feels a bit sharp, so don't over-chill, and you can even give it a decant."

"The word No refers to no oak and no malolactic fermentation. The wine is sharp in acids and totally dry, but with super-ripe flavors of pineapple, pear, peach and green apple marmalade. Very clean and mouth-cleansing."
"Modest, with citrus, spice and tobacco flavors, but nicely dry and crisp in acidity. You'll find tantalizing flavors of oranges, bananas, green melons and figs. A polished wine to drink now."
"Made in a tart, citrusy style, like an elegant Chablis, this rich, balanced Chardonnay shows candied flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, Key lime pie and stony minerals. Brisk acidity provides a keen, bracing balance."
"A big, powerful and fruity Chardonnay, made in the classic style of this cool-climate vineyard. It's massive in pineapple, kumquat, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Should develop mineral, nut and dried fruit notes over the years, if you want to cellar it."

Dry and crisp, it's concentrated in pineapple tart and peach marmalade flavors, accented with plenty of sweet, smoky oak, and brightened with crisp Monterey acidity."

"Opulent and captivating, this Chard captures the rich, bells and whistles style of California, while maintaining a sense of style and elegance. Coastal acidity provides a bracing structure for the ripe pineapple, lime, pear, white flower and mineral flavors."
"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare."
"Made of equal parts ultraripe pineapple and exotic lime fruit, coupled with sweet, smoky crème brûlée and buttered toast from oak and lees stirring, this is a super-rich Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold; it matures and knits together as it breathes in the glass."
"Made in a leaner, acidic, minerally style, this bone-dry wine feels ultra-clean and distinguished in the mouth. It's austere, but you'll find a core of pineapples, apples and limes. Great with a shellfish-inspired risotto. Elegant and food-friendly, it should develop over the next 4–5 years."
"Clean and crisp in acidity, with a rich overlay of smoky, caramelized oak, this Chardonnay has appealing pineapple, peach and lime fruit flavors. There's a honey sweet finish, although the wine itself is totally dry. Good price for all this opulence."

"Sweet and simple, with candied orange, pear and pineapple flavors, wrapped into a syrupy-soft texture."
"Quite good, but some vegetal flavors mar this dessert wine, which is very sweet, with 18% residual sugar. Such sweetness is usually enough to satisfy on its own, but despite the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors, a stubborn green streak lowers the score."
"A nicely drinkable Chardonnay marked by vigorous acidity and creamy-smooth flavors of pineapple tart, Key lime pie and lemongrass. Good as an inexpensive alternative to coastal bottlings that cost far more."

"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't. A firm scour of minerals adds the necessary grounding to this complex wine. Drink now–2013, but not too cold."
"Silhouette is Merryvale's small-production best of barrels blend from the winery's various vineyards. The '08 is a success, showing brisk acidity and new oak and yeast flavors and a creamy texture framing ripe pineapple, pear and mineral flavors. It's an elegant wine that shouldn't be served too cold."
"Lives up to its reserve status, being the creamiest and most densely packed of Roche's several new Chardonnays. With brisk, bright acidity and ripe flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and vanilla cream, its buttered toast and char flavors provide the perfect counterpoint from oak barrel aging."

"This older vintage Chardonnay has a flinty, saline quality to it and a faint taste of waxy apple. Medium in body, it's savory and surrounded by citrus tones with a high note of acidity. Clean and integrated it's a nice reminder of how Chardonnay can be just as fresh and alive five years on as upon first release."
"This is a good, rich Chardonnay showing lots of tropical fruit and vanilla, smoky oak flavors, and a creamy texture. It's made in the modern style. Not especially complex, but rich and opulent. Drink now."
"Shows all the hallmarks of the modern style of Chardonnay, with lots of ripe citrus and oak. The wine has too much oak, though, and is dominated by caramelized wood and sweet vanilla flavors that swamp the fruit."

"This Chardonnay is mostly about oak. It's strong in buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with suggestions of pineapples, green apples and pears. Shows good acidity, but is just too oaky to earn a higher score."
"Elegantly structured, a delicate wine with mineral and saline flavors. Yet it's rich in golden mangoes, Key limes and smoky oak. Shows how good a low-alcohol Chardonnay can be in the right hands. Should develop over the next 4 years."
"A disjointed Chardonnay, with aromas of apricots, grapefruits, limes and wood. Finishes dry and somewhat sour in acidity."

"Heavy on the oak, with overpowering buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. Underneath all that are pineapple and peach flavors. The finish is sweet and heavy."
"Chardonnay doesn't get much riper or richer than this. Dazzles with pear jam, pineapple custard, crème brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, and a firm grounding of minerals. Calls for the richest possible foods, like lobster. Drink now."
"Exotic, with tropical fruit, orange, peach, white flower, roasted marshmallow and spice flavors. Doesn't really taste like Chardonnay, more like Roussanne. The structure is a bit soft, but it's an interesting wine."
"New oak (38%) vies with green apple butter and pineapple crême brulée flavors to dominate this wine, with neither winning out, suggesting that it's balanced. It's a very pretty, creamy, slightly sweet Chardonnay, balanced with brisk acidity."
"Produced from this famous cool-climate vineyard, the wine is zesty in acidity and dry, but enormously rich and impressive in pineapple and pear flavors, with a distinct minerality that makes it feel drier and earthier. It's a strong wine, but subtle. Drink now, but not too cold."
"Rich and oaky, with brisk acidity framing delicious flavors of pineapple custard, buttered toast and crème brûlée. Elegant and impressive for drinking now."

"A rich, brisk and complex Chardonnay that shows cool-climate structure and the ripe fruit that comes from a good vintage and great viticulture, in a difficult growing region. The pineapple, pear and golden mango flavors are enriched with lots of smoky, buttery oak, and offset with crisp acidity. Decadent and delicious."
"Dark golden in color, this smells sweet—like caramel and toffee—which follows in taste. It's high in alcohol and oak influence."
"A gigantically flavored wine, massive in pineapple, guava and apricot flavors, liberally accented with 65% new French oak. Although it's dry, it may even have a touch of botrytis, to judge from the honeyed concentration. Defines a particular style, but it doesn't seem to have a future, so drink up."
"Very dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle citrus fruit and floral flavors, this Chardonnay suggests Chablis as its model. The elegant structure is likeable. If you're a fan of big fruit, it's not for you, but it's quite a classy Chardonnay. Good with cracked crab with drawn butter and buttered sourdough bread."
"Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast. The wine is dramatic, rather than subtle, and is at its best now."
"Bone dry and hard in acidity, this is an austere Chardonnay that lacks richness, and hopes to trade on elegance. It has modest pineapple flavors, touched with smoky oak and lees. Defines a low-alcohol, minerally approach. Drink now."
"A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce."
"Sweet and simple, with strong, honeyed flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, vanilla and buttered popcorn. Crisp, coastal acidity fortunately provides balance."

"A brisk, likeable Chardonnay. It shows ripe flavors of pineapples, peaches, lemons and sweet limes, accented with crisp coastal acidity. A hint of oak adds pleasant notes of buttered toast and vanilla."
"The vineyard sourcing here is half Le Bon Climat and half Bien Nacido. It's a fleshy, flashy Chardonnay, big and opulent, if a little obvious in crowd appeal. Shows rich, flamboyant pineapple, honey, vanilla, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors."
"Ojai is making Chardonnays in a drier, leaner and lower alcohol style than many others, but the wines reward for their extreme elegance and Chablisian minerality. This one, from a cool vineyard within sight of the Pacific, is streamlined, with flavors of citrus rind, tapioca and oak, and is very high in mouthwatering acidity."
"Despite oak-infused pineapple and mango flavors this Chardonnay is a bit brittle and tart, with an acidic sharpness all the way through. Drink up."
"Rich and opulent, in the California coastal style. The grapes come from some respected Carneros vineyards, including Hyde and Stanly Ranch, and the pedigree shows in the balance of ripeness and acidity. With pineapple, mango, green apple, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors, it's just delicious. Great with Dungeness crab and sourdough bread and butter."
"A hot, harsh and unbalance Chardonnay. Barely drinkable, except for some citrus and pear flavors."
"A pleasantly rich Chardonnay, brimming with white peach, pineapple, lemon tart and buttered toast flavors. Gets better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now."
"Way too much oak on this wine, which is dominated by buttered toast and butterscotch aromas and flavors. Underneath all that you'll find pineapples and guavas."
"The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity."
"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance."
It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.
"The vineyard is a great one, but this Chardonnay tastes way too oaky. It's swamped by buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch flavors that barely give the underlying pineapple and lemon fruits a chance to express themselves."
"Not very Chardonnay-like, more like a Viognier or Pinot Gris with its aromatic floral, tropical fruit, citrus, melon and spice aromas and flavors. Still, it's very tasty, and dry as well, with a crisp spine of minerally acidity."
"With a touch of oak, this friendly Chardonnay is a very nice wine for everyday drinking. It's dry and brisk, with pleasant apricot, tangerine and mineral flavors."
"Strong and awkward in winemaker interventions, this Chardonnay is dominated by buttered toast and popcorn flavors. Pineapple jam shows up, accented with crisp acidity."
"Not bad for a seven buck Chardonnay in a screwtop. Shows plenty of varietal flavor in the buttercream, honey and pineapple flavors. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases produced."
"Dry, creamy and crisp, with pleasant citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, this Chardonnay shows a lot of upscale character at a price under $20. Easy to find, with 200,000 cases produced."
"A rich, oaky Chardonnay, overwhelming in buttered toast, caramel, pineapple jam, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors. If you're looking for a big, strong Chardonnnay, it's for you."
"Good price for an elegant Chardonnay with such richness. The pineapple, lime and smoky oak flavors have a caramelized sweetness, but acidity is brisk, and there's a fine minerality that makes the wine finish dry."
"Dolan continues to produce stellar whites and reds from organically grown grapes in Mendocino County. This Chardonnay is ripe and full of minerality, a liquid form of crisp apple with vanilla on the finish."
"Some will find this Chardonnay severe and lacking in richness as it's marked by dryness, minerality and acidity, rather than tropical fruit and sweet oak.It would not be surprising if this wine made gains in 5–6 years, but even if it doesn't, it defines a more elegant style."
"Lots of tropical fruit, orange, lime, pear and buttered popcorn flavors in this Chardonnay. It's very bright in acidity, and is almost honey-sweet on the finish."
"Balance, elegance and varietal purity mark this wine. It's delicious and zesty, filled with pineapple, pear, green apple, honey and oak, wrapped into a texture of buttercream and with a long, spicy finish. What a great price."

"Made from organic grapes and packaged in a 500-ml Tetra Pak, this Chard is made from ripe fruit with a toasty caramel molasses halo around it, and finishes sweet. It would be quite drinkable on a camping trip or tailgate party."
"This is a dry, earthy Chardonnay, with an herbal taste behind the orange, kiwi and cream flavors. Crisp acidity makes it clean and zesty."
"Made in the popular style, with loads of sweet, smoky oak that dominate everything. Shows buttered toast and vanilla flavors plastered over the perfectly pleasant pineapples, lemons and minerals."
"This is the winery's best Chardonnay, but that's no surprise given its source: the famous Rochioli Vineyard. Right now, it's dominated by new oak influence, with buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. But there's an intense core of pineapples, oranges, green apples, nectarines and apricots, and the finish is absolutely dry. The vineyard's minerality and the Russian River's acidity provide balance. Give it until the summer of 2013, and then enjoy it for several more years."
"A disagreeable wine, with so much oak, all you can taste is sugary butterscotch. Too bad, because there's a decent Chardonnay buried beneath."
"Superrich, offering waves of pineapple, mango, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. The brilliantly crisp acidity of Edna Valley makes it all clean and brisk. Not much going on below the appealing surface, so drink now. Ahi tuna tartare comes to mind."
"An interesting and even somewhat eccentric wine. There are notes of green tea and herbs, but enough pure orange fruit to make it rich. Lots of zingy acidity, too."
"Made in the popular Chardonnay style, this shows buttered toast, buttercream, pineapple, mango and exotic spice flavors. Drink this rich wine now."
"Oak stands out on this Chardonnay, offering buttered toast and vanilla flavors. The wine underneath is a little thin in fruit, but it has nice Monterey acidity."
"Too oaky-sweet, with buttered toast, honey and buttered popcorn flavors overwhelming the natural pineapples and tropical fruits. Lots of people will like it, but for purists, it's too much of a good thing."
"Made in the Ojai style of modest alcohol, dryness and delicacy, this offers subtle citrus, tropical fruit and mineral flavors. It's not terribly complex, but it is streamlined and elegant. Drink up."

"Combines brisk acidity and minerality with orange, pineapple and honey flavors. The oak overlay is sweet and heavy."
"The poster child for too much oak. Swamps with buttered toast, caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors that are so sweet, it's almost like a dessert wine. There's lots of tangerines, pineapples, apricots and apples, but those barrel influences are too much."
"Too oaky, with buttered toast and vanilla swamping the underlying pineapple fruit. The malolactic fermentation has added buttered popcorn notes. An over-manipulated wine made to appeal to the popular style."
"This shows the streamlined acidity and minerality of a fine coastal Chardonnay, as well as the dryness. But the ripeness is impressive, suggesting notes of Key lime pie, lemon meringue and ripe, sweet kiwi, with subtle oak influence. An impressive wine from start to finish."
"Easy to like for its dry, clean Chardonnay personality, and at this price, a great bargain. Shows polished tangerine, lemon chiffon, vanilla and buttered toast flavors, in a creamy texture."
"Showing oaky flavors of vanilla, butterscotch and buttered toast, this Chardonnay has the brisk acidity of the Arroyo Seco appellation. The flavors are of pineapples, oranges and limes."
"With loads of sweet, smoky oak and superripe flavors of orange and pineapple jam, this Chardonnay offers consumers what they want. Good in a California way, but purists will expect something more nuanced."

"Overworked and oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast and sweet caramel flavors dominating everything else. Buried beneath are pineapple and pear flavors."
"Tastes like a white Rhône blend, with tangerine, white peach, nectarine and mineral flavors, but surprise, it's Chardonnay. Crisp acidity provides balance, and the finish is clean and elegant. Great price for a full-bodied white wine this rich."
"The coolness of the region and vintage shows in this Chard's acidic crispness and minerality. It comes down on the Chablis-style end of the spectrum, with hints of tropical fruits, apples and pears, as well as a welcome touch of sweet oak. Easily Silverado's best Chardonnay in years."
"A brisk, bright Chardonnay, made in the Testarossa style of ripe fruit and oakiness. What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for in the sheer power of tangerine, pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, elaborated with vanilla cream and caramelized oak."
"This is an appealing Chardonnay. It's a little sweet in apricot jam, peach, green apple, honey and buttered toast flavors, but the sweetness is balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity and a nice cut of minerality."
"Vine Cliff consistently produces one of the best Chardonnays in Napa Valley, and here's another one. The cool vintage gives it refreshing acidity, while the flavors are ripe and frankly delicious, suggesting pineapple and Key lime pie, vanilla custard, buttered toast, vanilla and dusty pie spices. A girding of minerality helps the dry structure. Really complex, and a joy to drink."
"Strong in fruit and powerful in oak, made in the popular California style. Impresses with pineapple jam, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors, in a creamy texture. Needs greater complexity and nuance."
"Loads of pineapple jam and roasted peach flavors in this rich, oaky Chardonnay. Nothing shy about its fruity power, with rich vanilla and caramel oak barrel influences. Could use greater complexity and nuance."
"This is one of the most Chablis-style Chardonnays on the market. It's bone dry, and has a steely, minerally elegance made complex with layers of pineapples and limes, and even a honeysuckle richness. The oak, interestingly, comes from Hungary. A terrific wine, far from the overoaked, buttered popcorn style so popular now. Production was only 227 cases."
"A block selection off the estate vineyard. Shows a lovely, firm minerality and leesy note, with rich citron, Asian pear, pineapple, baked apple, peach pie and spice flavors. An elaborate wine, amazingly rich and layered, yet so light and silky in the mouth."
"A gorgeous Chardonnay, so dry and crisp, it makes the mouth water, yet so rich it dazzles. Shows waves of tangerine, apricot and lime flavors, liberally oaked, accompanied by vibrant acidity and the perfect touch of softening cream from lees aging. Drink now."
"A rich, full-bodied, oaky Chardonnay, with the pleasing texture of cream. It's spicy and very flavorful in pears, mangoes, vanilla custard and buttered toast. Could be a little livelier, though."
"Sweet in caramelized oak and vanilla, with ripe pineapple tart, guava fruit and honey flavors, this Chardonnay is pretty sweet. But it's saved by crisp acidity and a good scour of minerals."
"Here's a ripely fruity Chardonnay that pulls out all the stops to achieve opulence, and largely succeeds. Defines the modern style of winemaking, with extracted pineapple, orange and caramelized oak flavors, wrapped into a creamy, leesy texture that's brightened with zingy acidity. Drink now."
"With 35% new French oak, this wine is dominated by the vanilla, buttered toast and caramel of wood. Underneath all that are pineapple, lemon and pear fruit flavors."
"Like tasting toothpicks. New oak accounts for just 40% of the aging, yet dominates with caramel, vanilla and buttered toast. Somewhere below are pineapple, pear, lime and honey flavors. Will appeal to Chardophiles who enjoy this New World style."
"A gigantic Chardonnay. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power. Dazzles with pineapple jam, mango, pear, lime, buttered toast and sweet oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. There's a minerally stoniness that makes it even more complex. Drink now–2014."
"With lots of sweet oak, this is a simple Chardonnay. It's marked by buttered toast, caramel, vanilla and pineapple jam flavors that will appeal to fans of this ripe California style."
"Made from some great vineyards, but tastes ordinary, with over-oaked flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Strongly flavored, but coarse and sweet."
"A nice Chardonnay to drink now, with rich tropical fruit, apple and pear flavors, enhanced with vanilla and smoky oak. One of the more successful Silverado Chardonnays of recent years."
"Dry, racy and elegant, a food-friendly Chardonnay to pair with shellfish in cream sauce, salmon, or a fine roasted chicken. Clean, vibrant acidity highlights citrus, white peach and nectarine flavors, with a rich coating of smoky oak. Drink now through 2015."
"A fine, delicious Chardonnay, less expensive than most of Testarossa's other single-vineyard Chards, but as good. Crisp in acidity, it offers very rich pineapple tart, Key lime pie, golden mango and lemon custard flavors, made even richer by smoky, sweetly caramelized oak."
"A beautiful, racy Chardonnay, with a streamlined structure that could almost be a fine, barrel-aged Sauvignon Blanc. It's marked by mouthwatering acidity, with savory lemongrass, hay, vanilla and white pepper flavors. First class and elegant as a cocktail sipper."
"As always with this vineyard, the wine is superripe, almost overripe, with extracted pineapple, pear, nectarine and peach flavors that are impossibly ripe. New oak adds even richer vanilla, caramel and buttered toast notes. Great acidity and a firm minerality fortunately balance all this flamboyance, but it's still a pretty powerful Chardonnay. Drink with rich lobster, scallop and tuna dishes."
"Rich in tropical fruit and citrus flavors and generously oaked, this Chardonnay is made in the modern style, designed to appeal. It's dry and properly crisp, with a fine minerality, but is overworked. You can feel the heavy hand of the winemaker."
"For the price, this is a good deal in a rich California Chardonnay from a major producer. The wine is dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, mangoes and honeysuckle, and the minerally edge that a Calera Chardonnay usually shows."
"Here's a softly rich Chardonnay that shows lots of appeal at a pretty good price. It's honeyed in pineapple, nectarine, guava and vanilla cream flavors, with a pretty overlay of sweetly smoked oak."

"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, lending buttered toast, vanilla and caramel aromas and flavors, while the underlying fruit veers toward very ripe, sweet pineapples. Made in the modern style, it will appeal to Chardonnay lovers of flash, but ultimately palls for too much upfront sweetness."
"This Chardonnay, a blend of various coastal vineyards, is marked by high acidity and great dryness. It is emphatically not a soft, honeyed fruit gusher. The sleek minerality and elusive citrus fruit flavors have just the right touch of buttery, toasted oak. Drink now."
"Tightly wound and sleek, a nervous, elegant young wine that needs time in the cellar or decanting to begin to open up. The lemon, lime, honeysuckle and buttered toast flavors have a distinctive tang of minerals, which makes the finish bracing. Now through 2015."
"While this Chardonnay is packed with ripe pineapple, pear and tropical fruit and has decent acidity, it's awkwardly sugary and raw. Tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce. The fruit is good, but the wine needs to be drier."
"are starting to recognize Clarksburg, for growing some amazingly flavorful Chenin Blanc and Albarino, but if it's Chardonnay they want to grow, too, this wine won't help make the case. From the Wilson Vineyard, it's sweet and uncomplicated and tasting a bit burnt."
"Over the top in oak, a clumsy attempt to lure in consumers with vanilla and caramel flavors that have little to do with Chardonnay. It's already turning old and tired."
"Gets the job done with modest tangerine, pineapple and cream flavors. Nice and crisp and dry, but it's pretty thin."
"A fine, elegant Chardonnay for drinking now. It has rich, honeyed layers of buttercream, citrus and tropical fruits and spices, brightened with crisp acidity."
"Kevin Furtado is a sommelier in Vail who owns this brand. The grapes come from some of Bien Nacido's best blocks. The wine is exceptionally lush and complex, showing flashes of tropical fruits, honey and minerals, tightly wound together in a firm structure. A really fine Chardonnay that should hold for up to 6 years."
"Made in the popular style, with sweetened vanilla cream and orange butterscotch flavors."
"Chardonnay has not been Clos du Val's strong suit, and even though this is a reserve, it's hard to fall in love with. Dry and acidic, it lacks richness by today's standards, although you could charitably call it Chablisian. Still, it's an elegantly constructed wine with some complexity."
"A solid Chardonnay, dry, oaky and rich, with nice, crisp acidity. Satisfies for its creamy wealth of pinapples, limes, pears and minerals."
"A good, everyday Chard. It's sweet in caramelly oak, vanilla, buttered toast, pineapple jam and butterscotch flavors, with just in time acidity to make it finish clean and brisk."
"Delicious and sweet in caramel, vanilla, pineapple jam, tangerine, lime and butterscotch flavors, this dramatic Chardonnay is made to drink now."
"Lots of tropical fruit, pear, peach, green apple, vanilla, honey and creamy flavors in this Chardonnay. Also lots of zesty acidity, which brightens the flavors and makes the wine finish clean. Drink it now."
"An eccentric wine that will appeal to some with exotic tastes. The tropical fruit, Asian pear and melon flavors are drying out, reverting to cashew nuts, herbs and minerals. With crisp acidity, this Chardonnay is headed into interesting, offbeat places."
"Everything tastes interventionist on this Chardonnay. The fruit is extracted in pineapple jam, the oak is strong, the wine went through malolactic fermentation, which gives it buttered toast flavors, and the acidity feels unnatural given the ripeness. Will satisfy fans of the New World style, but the wine, tasty as it is, lacks authenticity and balance."
"This is a very dry, acidic wine. It's rather austere, not showing much richness now. With a minerally tang, It's more like a French Chablis than an opulent California Chardonnay. Give it credit for elegance and finesse."
"Kudos to Chalk Hill for one of the drier, more subtle Chardonnays on the market. Theyve controlled the ripeness, reining in the tropical fruits to retain minerality, and allowing acidity to provide crispness. Nonetheless the wine impresses for opulence and complexity."
"A high-toned, brisk Chardonnay, packed with aromas and flavors of minerals, saline, umami, tropical fruit and spices. Feels rich and opulent in the mouth, with fine oak and a touch of leesy cream. A Chardonnay of great craftsmanship."
"Shows the complexity of Talley's single vineyard Chards, with vibrant acidity accompanying tangerine, orange, lime and mineral flavors, enhanced with sweet smoky oak. Brilliant acidity makes it compelling."
"Made in the modern style, with plenty of sweet oak and modest lime, green apple, persimmon and buttered toast flavors, brightened with acidity. Shows good varietal character for the price."
"Fat, oily, unctuous and honeyed. Shows massive pineapple, mango, tangerine and Asian pear fruit, with a savory spiciness and plenty of sweet, smoky oak. As ripe as it is, it's saved from simplicity by brilliant acidity, a mineral cleanliness, and a thoroughly dry finish."
"Brilliant acidity, dryness and tangy minerality mark this Chardonnay. The grapes come from the estate vineyard in the cool, southern part of the valley. Shows tangy, steel-tinged flavors of pineapples, oranges and honeysuckle, with an extraordinary richness that finishes dry."
"Superrich in pineapple, lime, kiwi and tropical fruit flavors, this lovely Chardonnay has a rich, balanced overlay of sweet, smoky oak.

"True to the Pride style, this Chardonnay is massively constructed, with an enormous blast of pineapple, orange and golden mango fruit, elaborated with sweet, smoky, caramelized oak. It's saved from being a mere fruit bomb by crisp acidity and a bracing minerality. Drink now for sheer hedonistic freshness."
"Very rich and oaky, with ripe pineapple, orange, pear, lime, buttered toast and vanilla custard flavors. Bright acidity makes the finish clean and zesty. Don't drink it too cold."
"Twenty-five percent new oak shows in the aromas of buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel that superimpose over ripe notes of pineapple jam. Purists might object to all that oak, but others will go gaga."
"Pessagno's Chardonnays are always big and strong wines, as befits their growing conditions in the cool foothills of the coastal Monterey mountains. This is monumental in fruit, bursting at the seams with ripe apricots and tangerines, sweetened with honey, yet finishing dry. It's a wine to pair with elaborate fare."
"Not much going on in this inexpensive wine. It's watery, with a sugary, soda pop sweet finish."
"Hestan only makes this one white wine. Though its beginnings might seem humble, the juice in the bottle surely will change anyone's mind. This is liquid gold in color, with deep petrol aromas and a note of toasted caramel oak.It's superbly balanced, with minerality winning the day—especially on the finish. This wine starts out like a California blockbuster but finishes very elegantly, with finesse."
"A blend from two well-regarded vineyards, this Chardonnay is ultrarich in pineapple, mango, pear and green apple fruit flavors that are liberally accented with sweet, caramelized oak. Crisp acidity and a steely minerality fortunately provide balance. Drink now."
"The winery's style is a leaner, more minerally and elegant Chardonnay, rather than the blowsy, ripe kind so popular these days. This '09 is quite fine, with brisk acidity and a steely tang to the orange and apricot flavors. Drink over the next three years with shellfish in cream and butter sauces."
"A heavy, oaky Chardonnay whose tropical fruit and vanilla flavors are dull."
"With 30% new oak, the wood stands out, giving the wine vanilla and buttered toast notes. Crisp acidity kicks in right away, giving sour candy flavors of pineapples and lemons, while the underlying Arroyo Grande terroir gives this Chard a minerally tug. Dry and elegant, it's a wine to drink now, with decanting."
"Sweet and candied, with pineapple and tangerine jam, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors. Interestingly, the oak is from Hungary."

"With underlying pineapple and lime fruit, this wine is overoaked. It's all about buttered toast, caramel and butterscotch flavors, saved by crisp acidity."

"This tastes very oaky, with notes of buttered toast and sweet, smoky butterscotch dominating the apricot and orange fruit."
"Acidic, in the winery's style, with a tart, citrusy brightness to the dry flavors of butterscotch, sautéed bananas, green apples and pears. An exotic Chardonnay to drink now, and dont serve it too cold."
"A strong, insistent Chardonnay, brimming with oak, acidity and very ripe tangerine, pineapple, Asian pear, lime and honey flavors. It's dry and tart, with a mineral edge. Should develop for a few years."
"Lots of oak on this Chardonnay, but it's awkward, and feels overworked and sweetly simple, despite some pretty pineapple jam flavors."
"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel."
"Sweet and simple, with buttered popcorn, orange and pineapple juice and caramel flavors."
"Sugary sweet and simple, with dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, lemons and baked pie crust."
"With Chardonnays this thin and one-dimensional, price is all important. This bottle is okay in pineapple and buttered toast flavors, but it's pretty simple."
"Heavy and sweet, with apricot jam, tangerine, buttercream and caramel flavors. A sound everyday Chardonnay for drinking now. Production was 10,000 cases."
"This is a good wine to drink if you want a modestly elegant Chardonnay to serve alongside food, instead of a big, oaky sweetie. It's dry and crisp and clean, with pleasantly rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, green apples, minerals and vanilla. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced."

"A worthy followup to the dramatic '08. Bone dry and zesty in cool-climate acidity, it shows bracing flavors of steely minerals, Meyer lemons, limes and buttered toast. A terrifically complex, Chablis-style wine made for upscale fare, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years."
"Lincourt's grapes are so rich and well grown that they don't even need oak to make a delicious Chardonnay. The wine is dry and crisp, with appealing flavors of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The savory creaminess seems to come from aging on the lees. What a great food wine."
"Tight and nervous now, with edgy acidity. The oak is strong and unintegrated, while the apricot, orange and peach fruit stands by itself, primary and powerful. It's a fine, complex wine, but needs time. Give it three to four years in the cellar."
"Despite vastly rich tropical fruit flavors and plenty of sweet oak, this wine is equipped with brilliant acidity and a stony minerality that give it balance. Kudos to the winemaker for letting the terroir shine through. Will be fine with the richest Chardonnay-friendly foods you can muster."
"This rich wine is has prominent flavors of ripe lemon, lime, pear, green apple and tropical fruit. Adding complexity is steely minerality, and while the oak is strong, the wine is still balanced. With a creamy texture and brisk acidity, this is a beautiful Chardonnay to drink now with lobster, crab, tuna or lamb."
"If this is the reserve, I'd hate to taste the regular. There's almost no fruit, with only a drop of citrus swimming in the alcohol and acidity."
"There's a bright, brisk vein of acidity in this dry wine, which stimulates the palate and gets the tastebuds watering. The true flavors sink into the middle palate, suggesting grilled pineapple, tangerine jam and buttered toast. A firm minerality grounds and braces the richness. Don't drink this Chardonnay too cold."
"Drier and more minerally than Foxen's other Chardonnays, because it is the least oaked. It's vibrant in grilled pineapple, mango, apricot and vanilla spice flavors, brightened by beautiful acidity. Alcohol is quite high, but the wine never tastes hot or unbalanced."
"A big improvement over the '08 bottling, the winery's '09 is dry and tart in Central Coast acidity, with pure, clean flavors of tangerine, vanilla and buttered toast. It's a lovely Chardonnay; drink now."

"This barrel selection has long been Signorello's best Chardonnay, and it still is. It elevates Napa Valley, not the most natural home to Chardonnay, to its finest expression. Earthy but complex, it has intricate citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, as well as a firm minerality. Drink now."
"Made in a bone dry, acidic style, what this Chardonnay lacks in richness it makes up for in elegance. Fans of sweet, buttery Chards won't like it, but true aficionados will appreciate the austere citrus and mineral flavors."

"Extracted and oaky, this will appeal to those who enjoy the popular style. It's strong in buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with a pineapple jam note."

"Lots of oak on this Chardonnay, which is dominated by toothpicky vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Underneath is a fine, crisp wine, with tangerine and sweet Meyer lemon flavors."
"Tastes pretty sweet, with a sugar and honeysuckle richness. But the tangerine fruit flavor is deep and impressive, and the vanilla and buttered toast notes from oak are what consumers like."
"Starts with a burst of fresh, clean lemon aroma, and turns zesty and bright in the mouth, offering waves of Meyer lemon and golden mango. A superior Chardonnay at a good price."

The flavors are complex, ranging from apricots and tangerines to lemons and golden mangoes, while oak adds lovely notes of buttered toast and créme brûlée. Drink now."
"Unbelievably rich, this tastes pretty much as excellent as the winery's more expensive Chardonnays. It really dazzles with its complex flavors of tropical fruit, green apple, pear, buttered toast and honey. It's all brightened by terrific acidity and wrapped into a creamy texture."
"Drink this polished Chardonnay now with shellfish or chicken stew. It's crisp and minerally, with a hit of acidity backing up the citrus fruit, honey and vanilla oak flavors."

"This has lots of tropical and apricot flavors, with oak and creamy lees notes. It's simple and a bit sweet, but should appeal to consumers."

Dry, crisp and minerally, with citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors, it's an elegant, Chablis-style Chard to drink now."
"A rather simple Chardonnay made in the modern style, with lots of flamboyance and flash, but not much subtlety. Strong and rich in pineapple and peach jam flavors, it's brightened with zesty acidity."
"The winery has been consistent with this wine over the vintages, and once again, the '09 is rich and layered. It's brilliant in Edna Valley acidity, showing the long hangtime, ripe flavors of limes, kiwi fruits, oranges and minerals that characterize this region."
"Rich and creamy, showing tangerine, apricot, buttered toast, cinnamon spice and herb flavors. A solid wine for drinking with roast salmon, seared tuna or a salad of bitter greens with goat cheese and orange slices."
"A beautiful Chardonnay, dry, silky and modest in alcohol. It's rich in oak-inspired tropical fruit, peach and Meyer lemon fruit flavors, girded with a tangy minerality. Will be great with a mushroom risotto or something lobster based."
"Dominated by sweet oak and sweet fruit, this Chardonnay is made to appeal to consumers who enjoy the popular style. This tastes like orange and lemon jam, with body from the alcohol."
"Simple and clean, with fruit juice flavors of peaches, pineapples, apples and apricots. A tiny bit of oak adds the usual creamy vanilla notes."
"Oaky-sweet and simple, with jammy pineapple, tropical fruit and honey flavors. The best thing is brisk acidity and a clean finish."
"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price."
"Full-throttle Chardonnay, creamy and opulent, showing lemon custard, orange honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp, zesty acidity. Exceptionally rich and balanced, it's a beautiful wine for pairing with shellfish entrées."
"A big, oaky Chardonnay, obviously rich and dense, but somewhat immature. Just doesn't feel like all the parts are working in harmony quite yet. Yet there's lots going on under the dryness, lees and wood tannins. Huge flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, minerals and flowers. Flashy, a crowd-pleaser. Give it 2–3 years in a cool cellar."
"Just delicious. Superrich in pineapple, white peach and sweet lemon pie fruit, with crème brûlée and buttered toast complexities, its opulence is balanced by crisp acidity. The finish turns unexpectedly dry and clean. Very fine, a wonderfully grown wine from this great vineyard."
"Rich and complex, this dry, terroir-driven wine completely avoids the sweet butter creaminess and jamminess of so many Chardonnays, showcasing instead notes of tropical fruits and pears. It's framed by minerals and even a fresh herbaceousness that suggests the wild plants growing around this Sonoma Coast vineyard. While the oak influences are strong, they are perfectly in keeping with the underlying volume."
"This is so dry, minerally and richly complex, you'd swear you were drinking great French Chablis. Brisk acidity and a steely stoniness give the apricot and citrus fruits a backbone of iron and iodine. Oak is there, but subtly lurking in the background, lending a hint of buttered toast. A beautiful wine, classy and upscale for drinking now."
"Awesomely rich, with massive tropical fruit, pear, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors, finished with cinnamon spice. Acidity is high and crisp, and a bright scour of minerals brings balance. Made in the modern style, this is a Chardonnay to drink with lobster and scallops."
"Another very nice Chardonnay from Durell. It's almost too oaky, with charred, buttered toast aromas and flavors dominating. But the underlying tropical fruit, orange cream and mineral flavors are fine, and so is the zesty acidity. The winemaker might want to lower the amount of new oak, or the level of toast, because the wine really doesn't need that much."
"This impressive Chardonnay from a small Livermore Valley producer is on the austere side of Chardonnay, with notes of just-ripe pear, tiny hints of wet stone, a nice, nutty finish and enough body to go with a wealth of foods. Good balance too."
"A delicious Chardonnay made in the California style of ripeness. It's fortunately balanced with acidity, which balances the sweet pineapple and honey flavors, but needs to be a bit drier."
"Tart in acidity, this has strong flavors of caramelized oak, pineapple jam, green apples and buttered toast. It will satisfy your Chardonnay sweet tooth."
"They packed a lot of flavor into this rich Chardonnay for the price. It's toasty buttery and popcorny from winemaker treatment, with ripe fruit notes of pineapples and exotic tropical fruits. A brisk streak of minerals and acidity provides clean balance."
"Rich and fruity, with tons of pineapple, mango, lime, peach, pear, nectarine and honey flavors. Lots of sweet smoky oak, too. Not particularly complex, but flashy. Drink now."
"This pretty, polished young Chardonnay comes from the sprawling Santa Maria Valley of Santa Barbara County. It's a good, dry wine, rich in acidity, with mineral-infused apple, pineapple and pear flavors, lavished with sweet, smoky oak. Drink now."
"Good price for a Chardonnay this rich and satisfying. It's oaky and ripe and flamboyant in orange and pineapple fruit, yet a brisk cut of acidity and minerality saves it from being too sweet."
"Spectactular Chardonnay, so pure, clean and delicious. Defines the cool coastal climate of the Sonoma Coast, with brilliant, citrusy acidity brightening long hangtime flavors of tropical fruits, green apples and succulent peaches and pears. A stunningly good, upscale Chard to drink with very rich fare, such as ricotta cheese-filled gnocchi with grilled rock shrimp and Parmesan cheese."
"Your basic California Chardonnay, soft, with oak-infused pear and orange flavors, brightened by pleasant Carneros acidity."
"Rich, if a little one-dimensional, this has flavors of creamy orange, yellow apricot, vanilla and buttered toast. It will appeal to fans of the forward style of Chardonnay."
"Fruit-juice sweet, like a pineapple, orange and peach drink, with high, almost sour acidity. Gets the Chardonnay job done."
"Oak, in the way of vanilla and buttered toast, dominates. Underneath are simple pineapple and apricot flavors that are watered down on the finish."
"A very rich, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. Made in an appealing style, with likeable pineapple jam, golden mango, buttered toast and spice flavors. It's an opulent wine to drink now."
"There's not much Chardonnay grown on Howell Mountain, but here's one to check out. It has an unusually pungent earthiness, leading to rich flavors of yellow apricots, lemon tart and kumquats, with a complex touch of mushroom. Bone dry and crisp, it should develop bottle complexities over the next 5–6 years."
"Dry, brisk in acidity and ripe, this has stimulating minerality that undergirds the fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, lime and guava. But what dominates is the hugeness of size and the richness that goes on and on."
"An exotic Chardonnay, this is reminiscent of a Rhône white wine, with its honeysuckle, mineral, apricot, tangerine and sautéed banana flavors. It's certainly savory. Don't drink it too cold."
"A steely, acidic wine, marked by minerals and a lick of metal. What fruit there is veers toward limes and peaches. Polished and sophisticated."
"The oak presently stands out, giving a blast of buttered toast, drizzled with honey. But the wine is very crisp in acidity and balanced and ripe in pineapples, pears and green apples. Could be an interesting bottle to cellar for four or five years."
"This is a nice Chardonnay to drink with shellfish, particularly grilled shrimp. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with rich pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, accented with sweet, toasty oak."
"Strong and eccentric, this tastes like the grapes from this fine vineyard had a hit of botrytis. But it's not sweet; the end result is dry, with apricot and honey flavors."
"A simple wine, with sugary pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, overwhelmed by sweet oak."
